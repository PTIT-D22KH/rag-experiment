    "context": "A few nights ago, my husband and I were watching an episode of Dragon's Den, the Canadian version of Shark Tank, and a \"social good\" company was pitching their Haitian recycling program. It was a bad business concept poorly executed, but it didn't justify one of the Dragons' responses, paraphrased below:\nYou're going about this the wrong way! You don't create a social good business before you become profitable. You become profitable by whatever means necessary, and then you give back! That's how business works.\nNow, I'll concede that there's something to the idea that a business needs to be successful in order for a positive end to be achieved. But her response is not an unusual one in the business community, and more often than not, the American Sharks who invest in social enterprises also buy this \"the ends justifies the means\" argument. Put another way, business people as a rule - and no thanks to Capitalism - prioritize profit over social good. If some money can be thrown at a few noble causes at the end of the line, that's great. But do what you have to do to thrive, even if that means exploitation.\nIn an apparent attempt to combat that mindset, there are now hundreds of startup brands on the \"ethical\" market that use buzzwords like social enterprise, one-for-one, and give-back to describe themselves. One would presume by the marketing that being charitable makes a company ethical, and I've seen many ethical bloggers and influencers tout these brands as such, even when there's very little data on their supply chain. But it begs the question: can a company really be ethical if workers are not provided a living wage, if they're not working in a safe environment, and if no attention is paid to the sustainability of raw materials?\nWhile give-back brands market themselves around the social good, how much good are they actually achieving? And is it enough?\nCharitable small businesses believe that they are doing something different by placing a cause front and center in their marketing. But, on a practical level, if their supply chain isn't in order, they may not be doing much more than a conventional business. They may be even worse.\nAfter all, those big, nasty corporations their marketing subtly critiques do the same thing.\nLarge corporations have a history of giving back. GE matches employees' charitable giving, Johnson & Johnson recently pledged 1 million dollars towards improving air quality around the world, and, since 2006, the BP Foundation has donated more than 218 million dollars to community initiatives around the country. Even Walmart, through its Foundation, awards grants and scholarships, and donates money in $200,000 lump sums to all sorts of relief efforts and deserving programs.\nBeing charitable is not a new angle. You could probably make the case that it's actually an engrained component of American enterprise, as fundamental as having a business plan. Americans really love charitable giving. In fact, in 2015 alone individual citizens and American businesses gave $373.25 billion dollars to charity.\nYou can look at this from a couple of perspectives. On the one hand, it's really nice to know that these hugely profitable enterprises are designating at least some of their profits to charitable giving. It's certainly better than nothing, and for the recipients of these pledges, scholarships, and funds, it can be life changing.\nBut it also makes it awfully convenient for these companies to never address problems in their supply chain - or even company culture within corporate offices - because as long as they claim they're being responsible, they can practically get away with murder (but, more realistically, with gross negligence when it comes to their most vulnerable workers).\nSo, when a nicely branded \"social enterprise\" tells me they give back, I have questions.\nWhere are your raw materials sourced? Who makes your product? Where? What's the wage? Have you visited your supplier? How did you choose your supplier, and why?\nIf they can't answer these questions with relative ease, something's wrong.\nIt's not that charity is bad. Charity is very good, and comes from good human emotions like empathy, love, and maybe a bit of guilt. Charity is what's needed in times of crisis - in famine, tsunami, and war.\nBut charity is also a bandaid placed on broken systems.\nCharities, by their nature, go where there is trouble. Uprising, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, bigotry, terror. No amount of external aid, even if given in love and good faith, can correct underlying systemic issues. Sometimes, charity makes things worse.\nThe documentary, Poverty Inc., explores the ways in which charity has become big business, delaying permanent infrastructure and job development. In Haiti, NGOs are often so poorly managed that money simply vanishes, given to inefficient subcontractors or wasted on lavish homes.\nAfter an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010, Americans donated tens of millions of dollars to relief efforts. Haitian communities were inundated with donated rice, forcing local rice farmers to compete with free product, running many of them out of business. Meanwhile, an onslaught of solar panel donations threatened local alternative energy businesses. Even if individuals were helped in the short term, the local economy was now dependent on foreign aid to keep it afloat. Not only is this unsustainable, it's unethical.\nChange happens when marginalized communities are empowered to transform systems of oppression into systems of flourishing.\nSocial good brands must realize that there are limits to charity, and that building a charitable business model without attention to the ethics of their supply chain or the long term efficacy of the nonprofits they support is both irresponsible and dangerous.\nThe best possible world is one in which charity no longer needs to exist because people are able to provide for their families and their communities. It is a place where individuals are valued and not exploited. Where the root causes of injustice are addressed before they can spiral out of control.\nCharity is only good now because it is necessary. But the world we should be working toward is one where people are far too important to ever be turned into charity cases, where we don't get to feel good about giving.\nWhere we get to claim that we're good only when we know that everyone is being treated as the sacred beings they are.\nIn the words of John Wesley:\nDo all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can.\nSo, businesses, by all means give to charity. But take it a step further by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain for the slightest sign of injustice and exploitation. Care about company culture. Care about the environment. Vet the charities you support. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.\nI originally covered this topic on my post on One-for-Ones. I'm hoping to do another post distinguishing between charity as a virtue versus \"charity, inc.\" soon.",
    "question": "What are some of the potential negative impacts of charity as discussed in the context?",
    "answer": "The context discusses that charity can sometimes exacerbate problems rather than solve them. It can delay permanent infrastructure and job development, and in some cases, it can lead to mismanagement of funds. The context also mentions the situation in Haiti where an influx of donated rice and solar panels disrupted local businesses, making the local economy dependent on foreign aid. This is described as unsustainable and unethical. Furthermore, charity can also allow companies to overlook problems in their supply chain or company culture, as they can claim responsibility through their charitable actions.",

But it\u2019s important not to get overly caught up in the post facto narrative your brain is going to create as it looks through the lens of that putrid score.\n- The truth is that the Oilers had a sh*t ton of great chances, and whiffed on a bunch of them. And the few they didn\u2019t whiff on were mostly stopped.\n- The Sabres on the other hand had fewer and less dangerous chances, but seemingly scored on all of them (and by my count, scored on three that weren\u2019t really chances at all!)\n- Make no mistake, these were two world-class tire fires going at it, and the Oilers have a lot to clean up, just as they did after the Flames victories. But the Sabres were by far the larger and stinkier of the two tire fires. Rewatch the game if you don\u2019t believe me (I\u2019m doing that right now to confirm my post game comments, and yes, it hurts a lot).\n- The truth is, we see this kind of thing regularly \u2013 goaltending extremes will pretty much always override whatever happens with the rest of the team. What I mean by that is that great goaltending will overcome a huge deficit in play, and bad goaltending will torch a big advantage in play. And the latter is what happened tonight.\n- What\u2019s that old saying? \u201cGoaltending is 50% of the game \u2013 unless you don\u2019t have it, in which case it\u2019s 100%\u201d. Yup.\n- On a side note, the reffing was horrific, as it always is when Tim Peel is soiling the ice with his presence. But that\u2019s not why the Oilers lost.\nGame at a Glance\nLeaderboard\n- Milan Lucic, Benoit Pouliot each had 1 goal\n- Leon Draisaitl blasted 6 shots on goal\n- Leon Draisaitl was most active on the team with 8 shot attempts\n- Leon Draisaitl was the faceoff champ at 70.0% (7-3)\n- Patrick Maroon, Jesse Puljujarvi drove shot attempts most with on-ice 5v5 CF% of 75.0\n- Anton Lander trailed the team in 5v5 on-ice shot attempts at 50.0% (4-4)\n- Milan Lucic was the big hitter with\n(click image to embiggen)\nForward Lines \u2013 Shots Taken\n(click image to embiggen)\nPlayer/Pair/Line \u2013 Head to Head \u2013 CF, DFF, TOI\n(click any image to embiggen)\nNHL Media Highlights\nClick the link to play the associated highlight video\nOkposo\u2019s first goal with Sabres\nLucic\u2019s first goal as an Oiler\nGionta\u2019s tip-in goal\nLehner\u2019s point-blank save\nGionta\u2019s second goal of game\nPouliot buries the rebound\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s power-play goal\nTalbot\u2019s great glove save\nLehner\u2019s strong kick save\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s goal from center ice\nMoulson\u2019s top-shelf goal\nAdvertisements\n4 thoughts on \u201cG3 2016-10-16 Ermagerd, wournded Burffalo r darngerous!\u201d\nIn the third at 5 on 3 the point shot bounds off the boards and goes to six of net where Talbot pad stops it. This about the 6:50 mark.\nPretty sure that puck goes in. Even worse for Talbots night.\nI wonder, are you able to get that clip? Talbots glove hides where the puck is and he slips it out.\nHmm, interesting. Let me take a look, I think I have a way to capture it as a clip if so\nYeah, I think I see what you mean around 7:00 left. it\u2019s certainly possible it might have been over the line, but as you say, it looks like Talbot\u2019s glove is covering it so can\u2019t be called anyway. Of course, officials have disallowed an Oiler goal where it was visibly over the line and not covered, so I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to call a covered puck a goal against!",

The Siagne meets the Mediterranean ocean at Mandelieu-la-Napoule, with its beach and marina, and a 14th century fortified castle which was renovated in the 1920s by an eccentric American couple - the sculptor husband renovated the interior whilst the architect wife applied her talents to the gardens. The castle and gardens are open for view every day, as well as hosting regular music and arts events.\nGrasse\nGrasse Cathedral, dedicated to Notre Dame du Puy and founded in the 11th century, is the town's most notable landmark and contains three works by Rubens and one by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, a painter who came from Grasse. Considered as the perfume capital of the world, scents waft from the prolific boutiques around town selling fragrances from Grasse's established perfumeries.\nHilltop villages\nTake your pick from several picturesque villages perch\u00e9s in the region, so called because they perch precariously on the hillside; Callian, Fayence, Seillans and Mons would make a pretty circuit for a leisurely afternoon's drive.\nLake Saint-Cassien\nKayak and pedalo hire are available to explore the lake, but a drive around is also very rewarding for its ever-changing views from different angles, with the opportunity to stop off for lunch at a waterside restaurant en route.\nFor art lovers...\n.... take a trip to nearby Mougins which has become a draw to both artists and celebrities over the years. The artist Picasso also lived and painted here with the tourist office once being his studio. There are now many galleries to visit with the museum of classical art also being present.\nThe Riviera\nThe beaches, marinas and chic boutiques of the French Riviera are easily accessible, around half an hour's drive away, with the nearest resort being Cannes-Mandelieu. The breaktaking scenic drive along the beautiful Est\u00e9rel coastline is also a must-do.\nThe Verdon Gorge\nHead northwest into the Var region to see the spectacular gorge, 25km long and 700 metres deep, formed by the Verdon river whose mineral deposits turn it a startling turquoise. Take a day to drive around the hairpin bends above the canyon, go walking or climbing in the National Park, or even hire kayaks to explore the waterways.\nHit Cannes!\nIf you enjoy a bit of retail therapy whilst on holiday, drive down to the shopaholic's mecca, Cannes, to seek out the designer labels. Combine with a spot of lunch at one of the many restaurants and a stroll along the famous Croisette.\nAntibes makes for a lovely day out...\nIt has lovely sandy beaches, great restaurants and ice creams shops, and an attractive old quarter to wander round. There is also the port to explore, and landmarks such as the Cathedral and the fortress. A big attraction in the town is the Picasso Museum, which looks out over the sea and contains not only paintings but ceramics and drawings by the great artist.\nTake cookery lessons\nat Les Apprentis Gourmets in Cannes.

You can choose a different scheduling mode options for some schedules based upon the priority and available resources, and you can control how often client nodes contact the server to perform a scheduled operation.\nRelation between SCHEDMODE and SERVERINITIATION parameters\nTivoli Storage Manager provides two scheduling modes - client-polling and server-prompted. The mode indicates how client nodes interact with the server for scheduling operations. With client-polling mode, client nodes poll the server for the next scheduled event. With server-prompted mode, the server contacts the nodes at the scheduled start time.\nBy default, the server permits both scheduling modes. The default (ANY) allows nodes to specify either scheduling mode in their client options files. You can modify this scheduling mode.\nAlso Read: How to configure TSM Client Backup & Archive Schedules ?\nAlso Read: How to configure TSM Client Backup & Archive Schedules ?\nIf you modify the default server setting to permit only one scheduling mode, all client nodes must specify the same scheduling mode in their client options file. Clients that do not have a matching scheduling mode will not process the scheduled operations. The default mode for client nodes is client-polling. The scheduler must be started on the client node's machine before a schedule can run in either scheduling mode.\nBy default, clients contact the server (client-polling scheduling mode and SESSIONINITIATION=CLIENTORSERVER). If SESSIONINITIATION is set to the default CLIENTORSERVER value, you can use either client-polling or server-prompted scheduling modes. The client might start sessions with the server by communicating on the TCP/IP port that was defined with a server option. Server-prompted scheduling also can be used to prompt the client to connect to the server.\nYou can instead prevent clients from starting sessions, and allow only the server to start sessions with clients. To limit the start of backup-archive client sessions to the server only, do the following steps for each node\n- Use the REGISTER NODE command or the UPDATE NODE command to change the value of the SESSIONINITIATION parameter to SERVERONLY, Specify the high-level address and low-level address options. These options must match what the client is using, otherwise the server will not know how to contact the client.\n- Set the scheduling mode to server-prompted. All sessions must be started by server-prompted scheduling on the port that was defined for the client with the REGISTER NODE or the UPDATE NODE commands.\n- Ensure that the scheduler on the client is started. You cannot use the client acceptor (dsmcad) to start the scheduler when SESSIONINITIATION is set to SERVERONLY.\nIf you modify the default so that the server permits only one scheduling mode for the server, all clients must specify the same scheduling mode in their client options file.

    "context": "How to know if you\u2019re in love? 10 tips\nIs it just a passing phase, is it a serious infatuation or this time, is it the real thing? If you can\u2019t figure out whether what you\u2019re feeling really is love, then it\u2019s time to do a little soul searching and ask yourself these ten questions to find out what you\u2019re really feeling:\n1. Can you picture a future without him?\nWhatever your plan is for the future, our first tip on how to know if you\u2019re in love is this \u2013 ask yourself this question: is it him in every picture that you have those future plans with? If he\u2019s there at your side in all your dreams of travel, children and even your career, then you must be getting pretty serious about this guy.\n2. Can you discuss anything with him?\nDo you feel comfortable opening up to him? If you feel that you can tell him anything, even your innermost fears and secrets, then you are on the right track. When you\u2019re willing to be completely open and honest with someone and you trust them enough to tell them about the mistakes that you have made in the past, then you are probably in love. If everything you say is designed to impress him, though, then you may not be quite there yet.\n3. Do you feel good about yourself when you\u2019re with him?\nOur next tip on how to know if you\u2019re in love is this \u2013 if you are truly in love with a person, then being around them will bring out the best in you. Love means that you want to be with that person for the rest of your life, so he should make you feel like you can really achieve things and go places with him at your side.\n4. Does he make you laugh?\nAt times, life can be tough enough without being miserable as well, so you need a bit of laughter in a relationship. If he makes you laugh and you can laugh comfortably with each other, then that shows you that you are at the same wavelength and comfortable enough in each other\u2019s company to be in love.\n5. Can you be yourself when you are with him?\nAnother good tip on how to know if you\u2019re in love is this \u2013 if you are really in love, then you shouldn\u2019t need to a put an act, when you\u2019re around him. You should feel comfortable enough to let the true you come out. If you don\u2019t feel relaxed enough to be yourself, then it is unlikely that this is true love.\n6. Do you ever run out of things to talk about?\nEverything seems interesting, fun and easy, when you are in love and when you\u2019re talking to the love of your life about things. You can always tell, if a couple is really loved up by the way that they are always talking to each other. Awkward silences are not a sign of a loving couple.\n7. Would you look after them if they were unwell?\nNow be honest about this question, because it really can be a telling one. Some illnesses need a lot more care, than just mopping the brow and some soothing words, sometimes illness can be really messy! Would you look after him, when he got a flu?\n8. Do his flaws still annoy you?\nAnother great tip on how to know if you\u2019re in love is to ask yourself this question: does he do things that really bug you? If you love someone, then you love them wholeheartedly and that includes their little imperfections. If there are things that he does now, that really get under your skin, then you do need to ask yourself how much you love this person. It\u2019s unlikely that you will get him to change his ways, and if it really was love, then you wouldn\u2019t want him to change anyway.\n9. Do you admire him? Are you proud of him?\nNext question on how to know if you\u2019re in love is this: are you proud to be seen with him and do you admire him? If you are, then that\u2019s a good sign, because when you love someone you are proud of them and their achievements, and you love to show off your admiration and pride about them.\n10. Do you value his opinion?\nAnd finally, another tip on how to know if you\u2019re in love is to find out the answer to this question: do you really care about what he thinks? You shouldn\u2019t have to do things just to impress him, but you should care what he thinks. Love means that you want that special person in your life to be happy and you will go out of your way to make that happen, because he makes you happy too.\nHow do you know you love someone? Please, feel free to share your tips in the comment section below.\nStay happy!",

    "context": "(JollofNews) \u2013 Prof.\u2019\nThus, the intellectual has a pride of place in the development of a country, in theorising and shaping its policy direction. Plato assigned such a role to his \u2018philosopher-king\u2019. If the ruler is not a \u2018philosopher-king\u2019 or does not have the \u2018intellect\u2019, then he or she is expected to surround himself or herself with men and women of intellect to help in such an endeavour.\nCertainly, directing policy decisions or being able to engage in their formulation would require a greater understanding of their intricacies and complexities and simplifying them for effective implementation. Our policy and decision makers, at the administrative, military, academic, judicial, financial and economic levels, by virtue of their interaction with ideas which they formulate into policy directions, in my view will also fall under the category \u2018intellectuals\u2019, they play such a role. Our religious lives are also greatly influenced by the intellectuals in that realm. The \u2018influencers\u2019 at these levels are who I refer to, for want of a better term, as \u2018intellectuals\u2019.\nWhat has been the role of the home-based intellectual in our liberation struggle from the clutches of Jammehism? Were they at the forefront of citizenship, of the fight against the dictatorship, of holding the Government accountable, of speaking truth to power, actively and courageously? Were they relevant? Did they rise up to the occasion when we needed them; when Jammeh and his group of brigands and murderers were running amok and playing dice with our lives? What role did our intellectuals play in our fight for liberation, for justice, in the 22 years we were under the Wellington boots of one man?\nGranted that the government was a tyranny and shouted down all voices of dissent from within. It held the sword of Damocles around everyone\u2019s neck. Our intellectuals gave what the Government wanted, subservience and sycophancy. They were, by and large, uninterested in local politics and in the lives and challenges of the other half, the worker and farmer in the backwaters.\nIt is fair to indicate, though, that there were strident voices of dissent from few of our intellectuals from in-country and the diaspora. There were men and women, outside the circle of Government, who had the courage of their conviction, spoke against tyranny and suffered privation, imprisonment and callous death. But these local voices were lonely and betrayed and they faced instances where their fellow intellectuals, instead of showing solidarity and \u2018unionism\u2019, pooh-poohed them as \u2018trouble makers\u2019 or their acts of sacrifice as foolhardy and cheap.\nThe Jammeh carrot and stick method, at once seductive and menacing, proved effective. Our intellectuals, I speak of the majority here, in both the public and private sectors, metamorphosed into sycophants and \u2018praise singers\u2019. They lost their capacity to speak truth to power. Instead of puncturing and demystifying the \u2018myth\u2019 that Yaya created around him, the false clairvoyance, they provided the prop for it, explaining it away and amplifying and glorifying it for the people to buy into it.\nThrough patronage, the loyalty of many intellectuals were bought and once they became \u2018yoked to power\u2019, they could not speak out. Through co-option, most of them became the mouthpiece of the tyranny. Through self-censorship, they could not provide the critical support and leadership that the down-trodden masses needed during those critical times. They knew he was a charlatan and a quack, yet our intellectuals praised him in his folly and ignorance. They admitted him into the circle of intellectuals and endorsed his \u2018ideologies\u2019, eccentric, idiosyncratic and incoherent, which were used to drive our development agenda. There were even some intellectuals who wrote or speak fawningly about Jammeh and his development strides\u2019 even though it was clear these were hoisted on the petard of their own opportunism.\nDefeating an entrenched dictatorship of 22 years, through the powers of people armed with nothing but a marble, and not the pen and the gun, is indeed a revolutionary act. But it is a revolution which should be perpetual- there is an ongoing struggle at the center of the earth between good and evil. We cannot be complacent or rest on our laurels because we have defeated a dictator. There are many other dictators lurking in the background, ready to take center stage if the people let their guards down; ready to dole out favours or prime themselves as the \u2018saviours\u2019 and become the new dictators.\nIn this new dispensation, our intellectuals must play the role expected, of providing leadership and critical advice regarding the consolidation of the freedom we have won for ourselves, contributing to the development of ideas and constructing intellectual frameworks that would guide national debates. They must distinguish themselves by their courage to stand for what is best for the country, not by their \u2018silence, submission and subservience\u2019, be defenders and protectors of human rights, and, when necessary, speak truth to power. When an intellectual has the chance to speak out against injustices, and yet remain silent, he or she contributes to the moral paralysis and intellectual barrenness of the country.\nAcademic freedom we should fight for and the University of The Gambia, our premier citadel of learning, should rekindle such intellectual debates. Our intellectuals must insist on autonomy, demanding autonomous spaces for intellectual activities and seizing it if need be. They must reconnect with the masses and remain, as Samir Amin averred, in \u2018living and close communion with the popular classes, to share their history and cultural expression\u2019. It cannot anaesthetise itself from the ills of society and remain a happy, fulfilled class.\nRegardless the role our intellectuals will be playing, I think that if we truly want to preserve the fundamental values of a democratic society, then all of us must display a certain degree of vigilance, be willing to take responsibility for what we do or fail to do, fulfill our role as active citizens, be ready to be accountable and to hold others accountable without fear or favour, scrutinize both the intent and actions of the State and be ready to stand for the truth no matter who it will hurt.\nWe should endeavor to know what obligations are placed on the Government, what standards it must meet and who should be held accountability for the fulfillment of our rights. Without the understanding of the obligations of the Government vis-\u00e0-vis the citizens, and the duties and sovereign powers that citizens have, we will not be able to hold our Government accountable or stand for our rights when they are violated or denied or just partly fulfilled.",

Now he loves desserts so I wanted to make something he would truly enjoy. I was considering baking for a second but then I decided against. Too hot! The weather was way too hot for baking.\nSo I made no bake chocolate biscuit cake and Dulce de Leche chocolate chip ice cream instead.\nI love Dulce de Leche! This thick and creamy caramel sauce can be used for anything really: a cake filling, cupcake frosting, mousse\u2026 No matter where you use it, you will be in for a treat!\nTake this Dulce de Leche chocolate chip ice cream. I added thick caramel sauce to whipped cream, mixed and stirred in chocolate chips for some crunchiness. Guys, it literally took 5 minutes to make. You only need a mixer and an air-tight container! Plus a bowl where you mix everything together. That is it!\nThis ice cream is creamy, rich in flavor and has a nice crunch to it. You can eat it shortly after you have taken it from the freezer which is great, isn\u2019t it? Because who wants to wait for an ice cream to thaw first before scooping it out from the container?\nNot me! In fact, I am not a patient person so waiting for something always drives me super crazy! You know how it is: I want it and I want it now! By the way, I prefer eating this caramel chocolate chip ice cream with a spoon rather than licking it on a cone. What about you guys? Are you a cone or spoon person?\nBy the way, you can add more (or less) chocolate chips and the same goes for Dulce de Leche. The latter can also be substituted with caramel.\nDulce de Leche Chocolate Chip Ice Cream is the perfect summer treat. 3 ingredients and 5 minutes is all it takes to make this no churn frozen dessert!\n- 1 Cup Heavy Cream\n- \u00bd Cup Dulce de Leche\n- \u00bc Cup Chocolate Chips\n- In a bowl, whip heavy cream.

    "context": "Kevin and I have been friends for many years and share a lot of similar passions for Christ and His community. As many of you know Kevin is one of the leading worship leaders in the Body of Christ and has been a mentor to many young bands including Delirious. Kevin is starting a new venture by launching the Music Coope. Rather than me taking the time to explain it I asked Kevin to do it in his own words. I encourage you check out his website and keep up with the new music that will be launched from the Music Coope.\nWhat is the Music Coope?\nMusicians have always been a cagy crew. Typically narcissistic and brooding, they are relentlessly in pursuit of euphoric inspiration that conjures heroic sensations usually reserved for superheroes and floating spacemen. Biblical accounts paint their origins in a rather suspect shade. Lucifer, the original angel of music who\u2019s very being was interwoven with pipes and strings, was so intoxicated with ambition that he was cast down from the heavens. Jubal is the name of the first recorded musician passed down from the Hebrew oral tradition. No surprise that he is descendent from the infamous Cain who slew his brother Abel in a fit of jealous rage. When questioned by God about the whereabouts of Abel, Cain\u2019s calloused response went something like this: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d The Music Coope is a family of musicians dedicated to being their brother\u2019s (or sister\u2019s) keeper. \u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d loses its\u2019 intellectual glory when applied to human relationships. The Coope is about cooperation, believing artists will render their purest and best work in the context of community.\nFounder and leading visionary of The Music Coope, Kevin Prosch, has a vision that harkens back to the Great Depression era. Prosch says: \u201cMany farmers fell on desperate times in those days and for most the only means for survival was to form cooperatives, or Co-ops.\u201d Farmers found strength and stability in pooling their financial and intellectual resources and many families and farms were rescued from abject poverty. Music Coope artists are using these same principles to create, promote and release their music while intentionally breaking down communication barriers between artists and their fans. Rather than selling out to an industry that has little regard for the artist apart from bottom-line production, Music Coope members are sowing into integrity based relationships with each other and fans of their work while creating a market place that is less \u201chustle\u201d with more \u201cflow\u201d. Prosch says: \u201cAt the end of the day these artists are real people with families that have tangible needs just like every other human being. The Music Coope allows them to make an honest living in their craft while fans find themselves privy to an insiders look at the creative process of music making and intimate portraits of the artists themselves.\u201d The first annual Music Coope Festival will be held June 9-11 in Amarillo, Texas. Registration information (registration discounts) and Festival details can be found at.\nThe Music Coope website will launch shortly and will offer fans an opportunity of membership at a very low monthly cost. Benefits will include free monthly downloads; free annual compilation CD featuring Coope artists, video diaries and interviews with Coope artists and monthly newsletters.",

    "answer": "The Music Coope is a family of musicians dedicated to being their brother\u2019s (or sister\u2019s) keeper.

    "context": "Moses' Prophecy of Messiah\nJesus as the Prophet like unto Moses\nby John J. Parsons\nLike the patriarch Joseph before him, Moses was a \"picture\" of Yeshua in various significant ways. Though he was a Jew from the tribe of Levi, he appeared as a \"prince of Egypt\" to his own people and was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (Acts 7:22). And though he was God's chosen deliverer, Moses was initially rejected by the Israelites and then turned to the Gentiles, taking a \"foreign\" bride. After being severely tested in the desert, he was empowered by God's Spirit to become Israel's deliverer for their hour of great tribulation. Indeed, both Moses and Yeshua were \"sent from a mountain of God\" to free Israel. Both revealed the meaning of God's Name; both spoke with God \"face to face.\" Moses was sent from (physical) Mount Sinai in Midian; Yeshua was sent from a spiritual \"Mount Zion\" in Heaven (Heb. 12:22). The New Testament relates that Moses and Elijah later met with Yeshua to discuss His \"departure,\" literally, \"His Exodus\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6) that he would accomplish at Jerusalem to redeem the entire world (Luke 9:30-31).In the Torah, Moses foretold of the coming Messiah who would resemble him in many prodigious ways:\nThe LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you,from your brothers - it is to him you shall listen. (Deut. 18:15)\nThis verse is the only place in the entire Torah where Moses explicitly identifies himself as a prophet of the LORD. Moreover, this is also the only passage where Moses identifies the coming of the Messiah as \"a Prophet like me\" (Deut 18:15; John 6:14). In the New Testament we read that the soferim (scribes) had sent a delegation to question Yochanon the Immerser (John the Baptist), asking him two questions:\nWe further read that when Philip encountered Nathanael, he said, \"We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote - Yeshua minetzaret ben Yosef (Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph)\" (John 1:45). After Yeshua).Yeshua is the \"Prophet Like Unto Moses\"In light of these passages of Scripture, here are thirty (30) ways in which Yeshua minetzeret ben Yosef indeed resembled Moses:\nHow, then, was Jesus a Prophet \"like Moses\"?.\nFor had you believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me - John 5:46\nRelated Discussion:\n<< Return",

I was very stoked and have to give a big shout out and thanks to them. Check them out on their Facebook page:\nIt arrived last Friday after much anticipation from myself and I was eager to go out and give it a shoot, and I thought why not give it a little review while I am at it. After charging the battery I flicked through the menu and had a quick play with settings. It is rather basic but I found by setting it to P mode I could at least set the ISO I wanted myself, rather than rely on the camera. I was also happy to see that in the colour settings other than Fuji Color and Black and white, they had a FujiChrome emulator which I look forward to playing with, this is supposed to emulate their famed slide film colours, I stuck with standard Fuji colour for this test. I also set the camera to center point focus as I find this beneficial to nailing the shots I want. The camera was setup and I was off to run it through it\u2019s paces.\nBefore I go through my thoughts and shots, I suppose I best list it\u2019s specs:\nSensor\nType CCD\nSize 1/2.3\u2033 6.2\u00d74.6mm\nMegapixels 13.8 MP\nLight sensitivity 1,600 ISO\nLight sensitivity (boost) 3,200 ISO\nSensor (Advanced)\nTrue resolution 9.7 MP\nNative resolution 4288 x 3216\nPixel size 2 \u00b5m\u00b2\nScreen\nType LCD\nSize 2,7\u2033\nResolution 230k dots\nTouch screen No\nFlips out No\nLens\nZoom 8x\nWide angle 25 mm\nTelephoto 200 mm\nAperture (wide angle) f/2.9\nAperture (telephoto) f/5.9\nMacro focus 5 cm\nForm factor\nSize 100x56x24 mm\nDepth 0,9\u2033\nWeight 129 g\nInterchangeable lenses No\nWaterproof No\nViewfinder Type None\nVideo\nFormat 720p @ 30fps\nSupports 24p No\nHigh-speed framerate None\nExternal mic jack No\nAutofocus Contrast detection\nContinuous focus Unknown\nAll formats 720p @ 30fps\n480p @ 30fps\n320 x 240 @ 30fps\nFeatures\nPanorama No\nHDR No\n3D No\nImage stabilization Lens\nSupports RAW No\nGPS No\nFocus system\nAutofocus Contrast detection\nFocus points Unknown\nCross type focus points Unknown\nShutter\nMax 1/2000s\nMin 8s\nFlash\nBuilt-in flash Yes\nPopup No\nExternal connection No\nStorage\nStorage slots 1\nSupported formats SD\nSDXC\nSDHC\n(As always click on images to see larger and sharper)\n(this image has been cropped)\nI went straight to the backyard and snapped this shot of this orange/red flower. Now I know this is not the best shot, however it is a good test of how the camera handles reds and oranges as I find many cameras/lenses struggle with these colours, often over saturating. I found it performed rather well in this department. However it is very touch and go, and could be prone to over saturation.\n(this image has been cropped)\nThe next thing I wanted to test was focus speed. So I grabbed my youngest dog baby doll and got a quick snap of her. The focus seemed fine and snappy. The B&W setting seemed quite nice too.\nThe center point focus also seemed like the focus point was fine enough to pick up fine objects as the desired point of focus. I did however note that being used to my sony nex\u2019s that it would greatly benefit from a tilt screen, however at around $100 retail. This camera is still quite a steal.\n(this is image is cropped)\nThe zoom does seem quite adequate and is rather quick to zoom to the longer end. It doesn\u2019t seem to lose too much sharpness at the long end either. I was able to snap this shot sitting in a cafe quite a way away from this couple with a dog. The 25-200mm zoom is quite handy and rather good for a camera in this class.\nThe close focusing distance of 5cm is also very good for a camera in the class and price range and the lens still remains sharp. I feel this could be very good for those that love to play with a little macro work, getting those shots of those little bugs. haha\nI did however note that there is some slight barrel distortion. Which will only really be noticed when shooting horizons\u2026 or brick walls. But again, quite adequate for a camera in this class.\nOne thing that did strike me upon editing these pics from the camera (basic contrast and re-size) is how \u2018filmic\u2019 the images look due to that great little CCD sensor. This is something you will not find in a CMOS sensor camera as they definitely have more of a digital look too them. I must admit I was looking forward to the possibility of this as I am also an avid film shooter and was definitely not disappointed.\nI enjoyed the look so much from this nifty little light point and shoot here are a few more images from my little test walk I took it for:\nSo after basically putting it through it\u2019s paces, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with this nifty little point and shoot and can see it accompanying me in my car often when I choose not to bother taking my DSLR\u2019s. About the only thing I could have asked for more out of it was the ability to shoot raw\u2026but then I did not pay for it, I won it thanks to Camera House. haha\nAll in all this is a very good performing, simple little camera, more than capable of taking some great shots if desired and definitely worth grabbing around the $100 mark if you are looking for a new point and shoot, or like me just a carry around camera when the Mrs tells you to leave the cameras at home. haha\nI hope you have enjoyed this little review, till next time, Happy Snapping guys! \ud83d\ude42",
    "question": "What are some of the specifications of the camera that the author won from Camera House?",
    "answer": "The camera has a CCD sensor with 13.8 Megapixels and light sensitivity of 1,600 ISO. It has an LCD screen of size 2.7\" and a resolution of 230k dots. The lens has a zoom of 8x, with a wide angle of 25 mm and a telephoto of 200 mm. The camera weighs 129 g and does not have interchangeable lenses. It supports video format of 720p @ 30fps and has a built-in flash. The storage supports formats like SD, SDXC, and SDHC.",

    "context": "Back with a bang\nI should never have doubted or even felt a shred of apprehension about Bloc Party\u2018s studio return after a four year hiatus. Kele Okereke\u2019s solo asides were much less than stellar but thankfully his experimental excursions seem to have benefited the band tremendously rather than hinder it.\nBy the time I was a fan, roughly around late 2008, opinions had already formed and solidified about their three albums and supposed progressive downfall. I went into all of them with no real expectations and was totally unaware of the growing discontent with the band\u2019s direction. Perhaps my blissful ignorance of the critical and public incense was a factor in my near equal enjoyment and appreciation of each record\u2019s intricacies.\nBloc Party had never let me down before, and they still haven\u2019t. Four is a collection of songs that are lucky to exist when you consider the band\u2019s recent history; tensions supposedly having reached boiling point after Intimacy, rumors of the search for a new singer. Four\u2018s name, aside from the most obvious numeral significance, seems to have another meaning; this isn\u2019t an album that gives the impression of being dictated by one person but rather, feels like more of a team effort (yes, they are four members in the band); granted, the lyrics are still classic Okereke, which is perfectly fine considering I\u2019ve always enjoyed his writing (it\u2019s mostly great here, once again) but instrumentally, the album doesn\u2019t contain a shred of the rather poor fitting electronica he\u2019s indulged in over the past few years, that particular itch having been scratched with his solo work. (and don\u2019t get me wrong, such elements have their place in Bloc Party but Intimacy demonstrated their limits).\nThose underwhelmed by Octopus should still make the effort to check out the album in its entirety. The debut single is likely the weakest track; not bad by any means but certainly meagre in context. Instead of computerised beats, the record takes the two thirds form of honest, straightforward hard-rock, hugely reminiscent of bassist Moake\u2019s Young Legionnaire. 3\u00d73, Kettling, and We\u2019re Not Good People find the quartet channeling their inner Queens of the Stone Age to fantastic effect. The remaining third, in particular Day Four and The Healing demonstrate their retained ability to create the touching, sombre, indie ballads which Bloc Party have been known and renowned for in the past. It\u2019s a combination which works well and never falters throughout the album\u2019s 43 minute running time.\nI usually like minimalism but in the case of Four\u2018s cover art, I can\u2019t help but be a little disappointed. It is a jarring choice considering the band\u2019s history of provocative artwork. What should probably be a striking example of \u2018less is more\u2019 appeal ultimately undermines the record\u2019s visual impact, a result of unfulfilled expectation.\nI\u2019ve looked hard but that\u2019s about the only flaw I can really find with Four. Maybe it\u2019s my Bloc Party fanboyism or a hunger gone unsatisfied for so long clouding my judgement, but I can\u2019t really care when I\u2019m still enjoying it so much after so many listens.\nIt was worth the wait.",
    "question": "What is the general impression of Bloc Party's album \"Four\" according to the context?",
    "answer": "The album \"Four\" by Bloc Party is generally well-received. It is seen as a collection of songs that are lucky to exist considering the band\u2019s recent history. The album feels like a team effort and doesn't contain any of the electronica that the lead singer indulged in over the past few years. It is a combination of hard-rock and touching, sombre, indie ballads which works well and never falters throughout the album\u2019s 43 minute running time. The only flaw mentioned is the minimalistic cover art which undermines the record\u2019s visual impact.",

He is the most respected prep coach in the Garden State and, should he ever decide to become a college assistant, would be a major coup for any Big East program.\n\u201cAt this point I\u2019m looking forward to two more years at St. Anthony,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI feel I need a number to get me to shut it down and the 900 is out there. Then I think I\u2019d like to try something else in coaching.\u201d\nJust the fact that Hill has such a strong relationship with Hurley is great news for Rutgers and bad news for Seton Hall. Seton Hall coach Louis Orr has two years left on his contract, but his status is in limbo.\nOrr wants an extension, but sources said the administration at the South Orange school is not convinced Orr has established solid enough state recruiting ties. The Pirates will lose their two best players next season \u2013 guard Donald Copeland and center Kelly Whitney \u2013 and they have no recruits signed.\nAccording to the sources, Orr is mulling three possible scenarios: He accepts a guaranteed one-year extension; he opts to leave because an extension isn\u2019t offered; he refuses to make changes to his staff, forcing a parting of the ways.\nSeton Hall athletic director Joe Quinlan did not return phone calls, but Quinlan \u2013 who will meet with Orr this week \u2013 has a list of candidates in case he needs to make a change.\nFormer coaches Fran Fraschilla, John Carroll and Pete Gillen could be successors if Orr does not stay. Gillen \u2013 who could also wind up at his alma mater, Fairfield \u2013 and Quinlan are longtime friends. In an interview early in the season, Quinlan praised Gillen\u2019s work ethic and style, but prefaced it all by saying: \u201cWe have a coach.\u201d\nCarroll, one of P.J. Carlesimo\u2019s assistants during The Hall\u2019s glory days, coached the Boston Celtics after a stint at Duquesne.\nHofstra coach Tom Pecora, who is said to be happy in Hempstead, and George Mason coach Jim Larranaga of The Bronx are also possibilities. Both are in the midst of postseason runs \u2013 Pecora in the NIT, Larranaga in the Sweet 16.\n\u2013 additional reporting by Tim Sullivan",

    "context": "The rest of the game is so straighforwards and easy. I took my girlfriend, one of the people who's going to play Friday in my Aremorican Addendum playtest, and we made a character in just a couple of minutes. Hit points, armor class, weapons, everything. It took almost literally no time at all, thanks to one of the least controversial and handy house rules I ever forget that I have:\nI call it the \"Ten Items or Less\" Rule. See, you can get basic items and armor for free (that's up to light armor and any one-handed item) for free, because they're practically free anyways and I'm not really picky. I don't require dynamic encumbrance counts, for one. Math at the table should be limited to figuring out one's hit rolls by subtracting THACO from the die roll, or by figuring out how much gold goes where at the end of an adventure.\nBut for two, you get ten items from the equipment table for free. You can have a bedroll, two torches, waterskin (water), flask(rum), two 50' ropes, tent, blanket, and 10' pole. Or you could have a hammer, 50' rope, waterskin (water), two blankets, three days of rations, a bedroll, and a tent. For free. Seriously, don't even count them, it doesn't matter. I'm not looking over your math anyways, just take ten items, stick them in a backpack, and spend your gold on weapons, armor, ammunition, that sort of thing. When you're done, though, all your gold is gone. Instead of keeping it, you get 1d6x10 silver. That's 10-60, roughly a month's wages for a skilled laborer.\nSee, this rule does a couple of things. Firstly, it means that players aren't agonizing over whether to spend their 5 silver on ropes at character creation. There are more interesting times to worry about gold, and that's at the table, not when we're trying to figure out who's bringing what and how. Second, it's essentially a starting package for you- you have some odds and ends, and it encourages creativity. So you've already got food, water, shelter, and light. You've got another item to bring. Should you bring parchment? What about a quill? Will we need pitons? That sort of thing.\nAnd lastly, it means that characters start out kind of poor. You know, the driving motivation behind half of what Conan does (the other half being revenge), and all of what people do in Theives' World. It's the simplest, and easiest motivation in the world. If a night in an inn costs 1 gold, and you currently have roughly 1/6th of one gold peice, you're going to need to make back the investment you guys just now made into all of that shiny armor and weapons and stuff. Hey, night's falling. You'd better get moving, the town guard doesn't take kindly to vagrants.\nAll of these things are good things. You still have to spend money outside of character creation, of course, so that the rope and pitons and stuff you brought will be more expensive next time. With any luck, of course, you'll be coming back to town with 500-600 gold, so maybe it'll be time to upgrade that plate armor for once, and then spend time in town recuperating and training and all that. Without any luck, you'll come back into town broke and half dead, with the blood of henchmen on your boots, but that's neither here nor there. Come back with your shield or on it, as they say!",

    "context": "Guys flirt in many different ways, some guys are touchy feely, some just constantly make jokes, so like to talk about how tough they are. I'm a little too shy for those approaches, so I've figured out the perfect strategy for instantly winning a girl over. It's a process, so it takes time, but it's so far been effective. I'm even in this process with two girls at work.\nAs we've learned, I'm not the type who can walk up and get a number on the spot, some guys have the charm, or body, to overcome the creepiness of that strategy, I don't. Just like all strategies it's important to pick one that fits your strengths and weakness. My strengths almost all reside on or in my head. I don't have the hottest body, genes have decided I should remain a bit skinny, so I don't have those huge muscles the ladies love. I do have cool blue eyes, boyish good-looks, and,what many women over the years have said is my most irresistible trait, dimples.\nI'm a shy person, I'm not a smooth-talker from the get-go, I like to learn things before initiating a conversation, or allow the conversation to come to me. At work, finding opportunities to talk or learn anything about an attractive girl is a bit tough.\nLike I said, this is a process. I like to start out by smiling as soon as we make eye contact. For some reason girls are totally drawn in by this move. I let this continue for a few days, then I go to the \"Hey, I recognize you!\" wave along with the smile. Then finally finding an opportunity to pass in close enough proximity to get a \"Hi!\" in.\nWow, I sound like a 6th grader dealing with his first crush now that I see this in writing, surprisingly, it's totally working. The final phase is sealing the deal and opening a dialogue.\nHow do I plan to do this? Easy, girls love compliments, and now that she recognizes me whenever we cross paths I won't seem like I've been scouting her out. Even though I may or may not have been...\n6 comments:\ni can totally see how that would work. not all girls responding to the flexing braggarts.\nYeah, I'd be kind of freaked out if some random guy just came up to me and asked for my number- \"Who IS this guy?!\" Your way gets around that :)\nI think this is a flippin good idea! Too bad i'm a girl and I don't know too many guys to work it on... haha oh well! I think it's a fabulous idea!\nThanks! There are some guys who just have the gift of gab, who have the guts to go up and start a conversation and walk away with a phone number, I am not one of those guys so I have to use the tools I've got!\nIt's really a crying shame that you're anonymous...you're exactly my type. Oh and you have freaking good taste in music.\nsigh. Ah, well :P\nWhat can I say?\nHandsome\nIntelligent\nCreative\nCharming\nFunny\nCaring\nDid I leave anything out? But even still, I'm flattered!",

I want to do this for two reasons. First of all, I love some of these books and would love to share them with you guys. Secondly, I know myself and my tendency to get obsessive during the semester and so, anticipating that there will probably be a posting drought in our future, I want to get some stuff posted here while I still can.\nToday\u2019s reviews are from Charles de Lint\u2019s Newford series. If you are a fan of urban fantasy and you haven\u2019t read any of the Newford books, you are seriously missing out. The series consists of novels and anthologies of short stories but I am going to focus on some of my favorite novels today and save the short stories for another time.\nSomeplace to be Flying\nSomeplace to be Flying is one of my favorite Newford books and, truth be told, one of my favorite books overall. If I had to recommend only one book to introduce a new reader to Newford, this would be the one. It really is de Lint at his best, creating a fascinating urban fantasy world where mythic, shapeshifting \u201cFirst People\u201d walk modern city streets. But it is characters that really shine here, characters like the Crow Girls and Jack Daw, that you can\u2019t help falling in love with.\nPromises to Keep / The Onion Girl / Widdershins\nOne of Newford\u2019s MVPs is Jilly Coopercorn, an big-hearted artist with knack for seeing magical things in unlikely places. Some of the best Newford stories revolve around Jilly and her friends. Yet Jilly\u2019s life has had its dark periods too. She has a history of abuse, of addiction and pain that she has never quite dealt with. These three books: Promises to Keep, The Onion Girl and Widdershins are a sort of trilogy that chronicle Jilly\u2019s life and recovery in a way that could only be done in Newford. There are times when the books get a little rough to read \u2013 and I don\u2019t recommend reading The Onion Girl without having Widdershins on standby \u2013 but they are incredible books in an incredible series and I strongly recommend them.",

    "context": "Continuing a tradition that began 60 years ago, Mercedes-Benz just unveiled their 2013 SL model. The letters \u201cSL\u201d have represented a blend of sport, style and comfort for six decades, but for the first time, the SL is being constructed almost entirely of aluminum, consequently tipping the scales at considerably less than its predecessor. The 2013 SL550 will become available this spring in U.S. showrooms, and compared with its successful predecessor, will serve up considerably more athletic character without sacrificing comfort, while setting new standards in the luxury roadster class.\nThe new SL is available with two different suspension systems, one of which is the Agility Control Suspension as standard equipment. The ABC (Active Body Control) suspension system is available as an option. Power for the SL will come from a new V8 that makes 429 horsepower; roughly 12% more despite the lower displacement, while generating 32% more torque for an increase to 516 lb.-ft. The engine features an ECO stop/start function as standard equipment, while the 7-Speed Driver-Adaptive automatic transmission has been optimized for fuel consumption and comfort. The SL550 will reach 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.\nThe 2013 SL combines its finely honed profile with a luxurious feel. Premium materials, perfectly finished with great attention to detail, define the style and character of the interior.. The 6th generation SL also offers a retractable hard top that can be operated using a space-saving electrohydraulic mechanism, converting the SL from coupe to roadster and back again in a matter of seconds. Two versions of the retractable hard top include either the glass or the unique panoramic roof with MAGIC SKY CONTROL.\nThe design of the new SL is not only aesthetically beautiful, it also boasts outstanding aerodynamic characteristics, giving the roadster top marks in its segment in three crucial areas: lowest wind noise, virtually on par with a closed sedan; the best comfort during open-air driving, meaning the roof can stay down even at high speed; and virtually no accumulation of dirt on the side windows. The SL is also perhaps the world\u2019s safest roadster, thanks to the collision-optimized aluminum structure, standard equipment that includes PRE-SAFE and ATTENTION ASSIST, plus further assistance systems on par with the S-Class. Active Parking Assist is new in the SL. Using ultrasound sensors it can identify parking spaces and automatically steer the vehicle into the selected space.\nOther new features include the unique Frontbass system that transforms the luxury sports car into a veritable concert hall with the top up or down and the highly efficient MAGIC VISION CONTROL. To coincide with the launch of the 2013 SL, Mercedes-Benz will also be offering a special-edition model, the Edition 1, for a limited period. It is superbly equipped and comes standard with AMG 19\u201d alloy wheels, designo exclusive leather with contrasting topstitching, AIRSCARF, the Harman/Kardon Logic7 surround sound system and much more. The designo crystal silver magno special paintwork is available exclusively for the Edition 1. Interior upholstery is designo classic red/black exclusive with designo black piano lacquer wood trim.",

Turn left on Porcupine Road, which becomes Echo Lakes road. Follow this road to the parking coordinates.\nHazards of Note:\nThe first couple miles of the hike are along a very rocky section of the Pacific Crest Trail. Watch footing along this route.\nCrowd Factor:\nModerate to High. This is a popular entrance into Desolation Wilderness and many of its most popular destinations. Get there early on a weekend to find parking near the trailhead.\nGeneral Notes:\nFind the trailhead at the south end of Lower Echo Lake, just past the lodge on the east side of the lowest parking lot. There is a kiosk here for Desolation Wilderness permits. Cross the metal bridge going across the lake outlet and pick up the trail from this spot.\nNOTE:\nDuring the summer you can choose to take the boat shuttle to the far end of upper Echo Lake from this spot for a nominal cost, and that will save you 2 1/2 miles each direction that you use this service.\nOnce you pass the Upper Echo Lake on the trail or from the end of the shuttle, you will see the Desolation Wilderness signpost indicating entrance into the area, and then the destination of Tamarack Lake is not far up on your left after a continued climb up to the elevation of the three lakes in this immediate vicinity.\nSince this is a hike into Desolation Wilderness, you will need a day permit (free at the trailhead) and the group size limit is 12.\nView of Becker Peak and Talking Mountain from the boat ride at the start of the trip.\nA look back at Echo Lakes from the trail toward Desolation Wilderness.\nA still mostly frozen Tamarack Lake with Mt.

Although some of your comments may be fair- ie. the stuff about Guardian readers being the guilt-ridden bourgeoisie- some others are disgusting and caused me to vomit copiously. There is no better national English newspaper than the Guardian. This has been, is now, and will always be the case. Please save your efforts for something more deserving. ie. the Daily Mail.\n- Eh, it's not thaaaat bad, but the basic thrust, ie. The Guardian is for knee-jerk leftists who aren't half as well informed as they believe they are, was done to death some time in the early 1920s, and has since stopped being funny.\n- I assume by Mail you mean Mirror. Goebbels would be proud of that arse wipe newspaper.\nAlso it should probably be noted that a fairly large % of the writters of this article are more than likely guardian readers themselves......--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:17, 24 December 2006 (UTC)\n- I think the first post above misses the point: The Guardian is, in its own way, frequently as ridiculous as the Daily Mail. Both are politically predictable, both are read by members of the middle class who are largely cut-off from what most of the country is actually like but think they know how to run the whole world, both promote a rather simple worldview that says a small clique (\"Rightwing Americans\" for the Graun, \"The Liberal Elite\" and the EU for the Mail) are responsible for everything that goes wrong in the world, and both are officially \"moderate\" in their politics (\"Liberal\" and \"Conservative\" respectively) but have in-house writers (and certainly readers, judging by their websites) who are rather more extreme. I think the Guardian's the better paper because it's far more intelligent, I personally tend to agree with it more (although that's more my politics than anything else) and it's \"official\" editorial stance is rather more balanced than the Mail's. But it's still, in many ways, a paper as ripe for satirical takedown as the Mail. --Zarbag 16:00, July 20, 2010 (UTC)\nedit Pinched joke\nThe thing about Sun readers wanting to rule the world etc is a straight steal off Yes, Prime Minister -- I don't want to remove it cos it's moderately amusing and without it the opener would be boring, but replacing it with something actually original would be good.\n- Congrats your the first person to notice where it was ripped from in almost a year and a half, I think there is nowt wrong from stealing this little bit from YM/TPM given that most readers are unlikely to have seen it--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:15, 24 December 2006 (UTC)\nWell the history of The Guardian is a variant on the Wikipedia article on The Sun. When whoever wrote much of the original finds this, he will doubtless both laugh and cry ;). Seriously, as the demographics are increasingly the main thing separating newspapers rather than content or treatment we should develop this. Mark Lawson as the cultural commentator for The Sun and the Five television channel perhaps. Finger 19:11, 13 June 2007 (UTC)\nedit Improvements?\nThis article is starting to take shape but there are still, I think, some problems:\n- The \"communism\" thing - I have the same problem with this as I have with stuff about Mail readers striding around in jackboots doing stiff-armed salutes all day, namely that it's misdirected satire. The average Graun reader in the popular imagination is more of a sandle-wearing,middle-class or upper-middle-class middlebrow who, like Mail readers, gets all \"his\" opinions from his favourite paper and its columnists. He's probably a \"champagne socialist\" who's vaguely supportive of the far-left but wouldn't want to mix with them socially. He's also obsessed with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and can divert any kind of conversation towards it (this last one seems to be largely true, judging by the CiF messageboards).\n- The \"History\" section needs a complete rewrite. I think a nice angle would be the fact that the Graun used to be a Manchester-based socialist newspaper and has become a very middle-class, very very London-centric \"liberal\" (in the American sense) newspaper. Perhaps show this happening slowly over time as the flat-cap \"provincial\" socialists are pushed aside by the metropolitan types.\n- Some bits of it are still very weak and a bit lazy - like the \"past editors\" bit.\n- It needs more stuff about the Graun's various sections. I've already done a wee section on the various cartoons found in the paper.\n--Zarbag 14:27, May 21, 2011 (UTC)\n- Will consider a rewrite on the History Section as it doesn't fit with the rest of the article. --\nRomArtus*Imperator \u00ae (Orate) 01:46, January 21, 2012 (UTC)\n- Rewrite done. Still left a lot of the original paragraphs there but still needs more polish. --\nRomArtus*Imperator \u00ae (Orate) 13:19, January 21, 2012 (UTC)",

Trends in this year\u2019s discussions were artificial intelligence, curated data visualization and aligning business with technology and government partnerships to source the right data.\nFollowing are highlights from several of the discussions:\nData Visualization Keynote \u2013 Audrey Halvorson and Raji Dasari told a story about how adopting Tableau reduced IT costs for generating reports and data visualizations and provided the customer and provider with a 360-degree experience.\nCustomer Experience Backbone Keynote \u2013 Cindy Montgomery and Garrett Anderson put forward a new system architecture that incorporates artificial intelligence into the data analysis process. They demonstrated how a banner in their online member portal would be displayed based on the persona that the AI would associate to the member. The banner would provide a link to further information tailored to the member. He foresees integrating the Customer Experience Backbone and AI with chatbots and other interactive tools.\nMember Information: The Big Picture \u2013 Brent Leland from BCBSKC talked about the importance of a good member patient index algorithm to reduce operating costs by automatically matching data records and alleviate manual data processing. Marco Weixler from ICW, who partnered with BCBSKC on the project, developed an engine based on a statistical model to automate the matching process.\nMedication Reconciliation Provider Data Enablement \u2013 Allison Combs and Louis Polite presented the business and technical perspectives of BCBSM\u2019s achievements to integrate with the MiHIN member data feed. MiHIN is a state-wide network for routing health records between interested parties. They have a publish & subscribe model and a security model for dealing with sensitive information. By integrating with the MiHIN network, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan will improve its data to offer competitive pharmacy services benefits, wellness and care management intervention benefits, and medical reconciliation programs. We look forward to hearing an update next year on the evolution of the system.\nLeveraging Key Indicators to Drive Benefit Decisions \u2013 Timothy Donald presented the BCBSNJ configuration of Tableau to help with the sales process and drive the decision process.\nGartner Keynote \u2013 Jeff Cribbs presented a vision of the future of the healthcare insurance industry. A thought-provoking presentation, Jeff proposed the Health Value Management Organization (HVMO) \u2013 a transformation in the industry towards proving improved health value to the customer. The areas targeted for innovation were artificial intelligence in health IT, a member engagement hub, economics of connection and the Internet of Things like home health monitoring.\nThe Jonah Group team shared with attendees some of our recent work with Michigan Health Insurance providers.\n- Built for a leading IPA in Michigan, HealthFocus is a web application that allows practitioners to manage patient care, their measures, and provider compliance rates & goals. The application is fully integrated with the host\u2019s existing data warehouse.\n- Also built for the data warehouse is a pair of critical processing engines. The first provides a master patient reference with heuristics for cleansing, merging, and matching duplicate and near-duplicate patient data from disparate and volatile external data feeds. The second is a HEDIS measure and conditions engine for calculation of compliance rates across a range of over one hundred different measures and across hundreds of practice offices.\nWith data analytics and big data being a common theme, Jonah Group\u2019s work with AMD was of interest. We designed, built and implemented a big data system on Hadoop.\nThe symposium board members did a great job lining up interesting talks, facilitating good networking opportunities and providing fun entertainment. The event was a great success!\nInterested in learning more, please contact me matthew.solo@jonahgroup.com or Donghui Li, SVP Solution Delivery, Health Insurance, donghui.li@jonahgroup.com\n",

    "context": "Armagh ready for fresh promotion push\nJanuary 26, 2015\nRichard Bullick\nArmagh will look to inspirational All Star corner back Mairead Tennyson to effectively curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in Sunday\u2019s National League opener at Cloghan (2pm).\nMcLaughlin is the talk of the country after firing Termon to the All-Ireland Senior Club Championship before Christmas and Armagh got a glimpse of her prowess in last June\u2019s Ulster semi-final.\nBut switching Tennyson to mark her that day in Lisnaskea proved an inspired decision by manager James Daly and the Silverbridge livewire looks likely to take direct responsibility again this weekend.\nTennyson and veteran vice-captain Caoimhe Morgan are a very experienced pair of Orchard defenders and the latter\u2019s sister Sarah Marley will be back alongside them in the Armagh rearguard after missing last summer\u2019s entire Championship campaign with a broken ankle.\nThe tenacious corner back\u2019s return will presumably enable St Paul\u2019s schoolgirl Louise Kenny to slot into the vacancy left by stalwart wing back Sharon Reel stepping back due to business pressures though the likes of Rebecca O\u2019Reilly, Roisin Murphy, Danielle Morgan and Shauna Grey will also have their eye on a starting spot.\nO\u2019Reilly got a taste of the big-time last summer when deputising for injured Carrickcruppen clubmate Marian McGuinness in the All-Ireland quarter and semi-finals and will hopefully push hard for further opportunities now her experienced colleague has returned.\nA third Marley sibling, Niamh, wasn\u2019t fit to start that last Donegal game, in which Armagh found themselves trailing by four points early on, but played a prominent part in turning the tide following her introduction.\nArmagh went on to win by six that day but Donegal have home advantage this time and have been buoyed by that Termon triumph so will want to avenge last summer\u2019s result and start strongly as they bid to bounce back from relegation.\nFor their part, Armagh are determined to hit the ground running in their bid for a second successive promotion in the NFL and, although this should be a significant step-up from Division Three which they romped through with a 100 percent record 12 months ago, the Orchard outfit beat four top flight teams last summer in the Championship.\nThese sides spent last spring playing two League levels apart but appear well matched and are both tipped to make the play-offs along with Westmeath, with Meath and Down also hopeful of a top-four finish.\nOn paper this arguably looks like Armagh\u2019s toughest game of the entire campaign and something of a baptism of fire in an otherwise favourable fixture list which has handed them five home matches out of the remaining six.\nIn a division dominated by Ulster sides, Daly\u2019s ladies won\u2019t have to leave their own province for a regular League game and, with the only other trip being to Cavan, this weekend\u2019s road trip to beyond Ballybofey is the longest journey they will undertake.\nWith the table\u2019s top two being given home semi-finals for the first time, every match counts for more than in previous seasons and although this first result will hardly define anyone\u2019s season, both teams are expected to put their best foot forward for what should be an intriguing tussle.\nEspecially if former captain Mags McAlinden has hung up her inter-county boots, Daly might hand a first start to young Shane O\u2019Neill\u2019s shooting star Aimee Mackin in the full forward line or utilise the teenager as an impact player off the bench.\nLast season\u2019s supersub Siobhan Mackle is off to the United States on a university placement so the Armagh manager could earmark Mackin as the new ace up his sleeve to bring on in the hope of changing a tight game.\nAlready an established senior international in women\u2019s soccer, prolific forward Mackin has developed physically since her brief involvement last spring and, with her 18th birthday looming in April, appears ready to contribute to the Orchard cause.\nTeam-mates Sinead McCleary and Niamh Henderson had both worn the orange jersey in Croke Park finals before turning 18 and ace markswoman Mackin should prove a very valuable addition to the Armagh ranks this season.\nOther fresh faces in the panel include her Shane O\u2019Neill\u2019s club colleague Moya Feehan, Forkhill sisters Lauren and Megan Sheridan and Lissummon\u2019s Sarah Gamble, a diminutive centre half forward who really caught the eye at club level last season.\nEvery manager wants increasing competition for places and developing depth is one of Armagh\u2019s aims as they seek to build on the impressive progress of 2014 and deliver on their trio of challenging goals for this season.\nSecuring back to back promotions, retaining their provincial crown and reaching Croke Park in September are testing targets but Armagh have been back in training since November and are ambitious to show that last season\u2019s surprise package are no flash in the pan.\nHaving initially taken time to consider their futures, the highly-regarded Daly and his impressive management team are back fully focused on taking this team to another level and the players have been working with Ireland\u2019s top trainer Mike McGurn ahead of the new campaign.\nIn iconic captain Caroline O\u2019Hanlon, Armagh have the All-Ireland Player of the Year in their ranks while the versatile McCleary and forceful centre half forward Fionnuala McKenna can go one better than their richly-deserved All Star nominations of last term.\nLast season\u2019s newcomers, Crossmaglen\u2019s Lauren McConville and Aoife McCoy of Dromintee, got 27 starts between them in Armagh\u2019s 14 matches in 2014 which shows how it is possible for fresh talent to force its way into what looks like a settled side.\nFew will emulate her All Star status but Tennyson\u2019s superb example last season in finding a new personal level can also inspire players to hit fresh heights and help push Armagh to greater glory.\nArmagh are no longer under the wider radar and last season\u2019s success brought the All Ireland dream back to life, but for now Daly and his players are rightly fully focused on an NFL promotion push and this Donegal game will be a tough first test of their credentials.",

Bauchau brings thirty-plus years of experience in the rotorcraft field to the university. He is a widely recognized scholar in aeromechanics of rotorcraft, multibody and structural dynamics, composite structures, and wind turbine systems.\nSupported through an endowment from Sikorsky and United Technologies, the Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is part of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and serves to support enhanced research specialization in areas related to rotorcraft. Sikorsky Aircraft is a world leader in helicopter design, manufacture and service headquartered in Connecticut, and is a subsidiary of United Technologies.\nDr. Bauchau\u2019s work on comprehensive aeromechanics analysis of rotorcraft, modeling of flexible multibody systems involving composite structures, and modeling of rotor lag dampers are pioneering efforts in the rotary-wing field. At Maryland he aims to harness research being done in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and rotorcraft to contribute to his computational modeling work in both rotorcraft and the wind energy industry.\nIn addition to an extensive research background, Bauchau brings strong industry and government relationships. He is the architect behind the comprehensive multibody dynamics code, DYMORE, which is widely adopted by companies like Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter, government laboratories such as NASA Ames Research Center and academic institutions. The code is used to model all aspects of helicopter design such as dynamics, aerodynamics, controls, and composite materials.\n\"It's very exciting to be here,\" Bauchau said. \"Maryland has always had a strong program in rotorcraft, and this professorship sends a very clear signal that Maryland continues to grow and strengthen that area of research.\"\nBauchau completed his Ph.D. (1981) in Aeronautics & Astronautics at MIT in the area of Structural Dynamics. In 1983, he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Mechanics, and later became Associate Professor with Tenure. In 1995, Bauchau moved to Georgia Tech as a Professor in Aerospace Engineering until 2010, when he joined the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (Shanghai, China) as a Professor. He joined Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2014 as Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.\nBauchau is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and he has authored two textbooks and published 88 archival journal papers and 175 conference proceedings papers. In 2012, he received the Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association. Recognized as an outstanding teacher, Georgia Tech twice awarded him their \u201cThanks for Being a Great Teacher\u201d Award, and during his academic career, he has advised 22 students who completed their Ph.D. dissertations.\nMost recently, ASME recognized his numerous contributions to the field by awarding him the 2016 ASME d\u2019Alembert Award. The award, established in 2005, recognizes his lifelong contributions to the field of multibody system dynamics.\nThe Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is one of many efforts in the long-term relationship between United Technologies, Sikorsky and the Clark School of Engineering to expand Maryland's rotorcraft curriculum, research programs and intellectual capital while being a continuous source for the world's best rotorcraft engineers..",

    "context": "The Beverley Hills apartment buildings are curious, full of character, and to be honest, a little out of place. Situated on the banks of the Yarra River, with Melbourne\u2019s gleaming city skyline beyond, these buildings channel a kind of faded Hollywood glamour, and are often the subject of intrigue for passers by, inspiring a certain level of curiosity about those who might live here, and the stories from bygone years which might have unfolded within these walls.\nConstructed by architect and developer Howard Lawson between 1935 and 1936, the Beverley Hills complex comprises two separate buildings, and as the name suggests, the development has a distinctly international flavour, referencing a 1930\u2019s Hollywood / Spanish revival aesthetic, with ornate stairwells and windows, almost gothic detailing and stuccoed walls. With an impressive outdoor pool and lush gardens overflowing with palms, vines and creepers, this is about as close as Melbourne gets to LA, or perhaps even Barcelona, aesthetically speaking.\nYoung couple Ellie King (an illustrator, designer and proprietor of online shop Pieces 4 Places) and her partner Cale Sexton, a musician, have lived in this apartment for just four months. They took over the lease from close friends, who actually moved into another apartment in the same building. It\u2019s not uncommon, when apartments become available here, for them to be quickly snapped up via word of mouth, or for tenants to move from one apartment to another. \u2018Beverley Hills is definitely a place where it helps to know someone that lives here if you what to rent a place\u2019 says Ellie. \u2018It\u2019s run by a wonderful man named Don. You gotta get past him if you want to make it in!\u2019\nEllie is a versatile and entrepreneurial creative, she\u2019s an illustrator and designer, and also creates her own intricate and irreverent hand embroidered artworks and homewares under the name Rittle. She also has a special gift for sourcing the most weird and wonderful vintage textiles, ceramics and art, hence the recent launch of her online store, Pieces 4 Places.\nAt home, Ellie\u2019s most treasured possessions include the large Matlok Griffiths painting above her bed. It holds fond memories and makes her feel somewhat \u2018grown up\u2019.\n\u2018The painting was found through my good friend Lou\u2019s gallery, Chapter House Lane, which was right next to a cafe I used to have in the city\u2019 explains Ellie. \u2018CHL is a non for profit gallery that Lou has been running for around 4 years. I was living in an apartment in the city for the first time by myself, and wanted to feel grown up and start an art collection, so I started with the biggest piece of his that I could find. Matlok is an amazing Melbourne-based artist so I\u2019m very proud to have one of his pieces above my bed!\u2019\nHaving been here for just four months, the novelty of living in this iconic building has yet to wear off for Ellie and Cale. \u2018It feels like you are on holiday in another country!\u2019 says Ellie. Aside from the unique character of the building itself (not to mention that incredible pool!), the community here is very much at the heart of what makes these apartments special. \u2018We have excellent neighbours that lend you blenders when you want a smoothie but are too cheap to go out and buy one\u2019 Ellie confirms.

    "context": "What is Testing?\nIn the software development life cycle, we find that testing is an important and integral part. Most people are of the view that testing phase can only be initiated for testing once the code is ready. They are wrong!!!\nTesting will in fact be initiated from the requirements gathering phase until the stage when the product goes live. i.e. into production.\nLet\u2019s see the set of documents that aid testing during the various phases of software development.\nWith the onus on testing to deliver quality products, it became necessary to have a set of documents that are manageable and make sense to the development community. In comes various tools that will aid the testing and development community to track these documents. These tools manage all the testing activities and provide different kinds of reports.\nThe most prominent one of these tools is the Quality Center.\nVisible advantages of using Quality Center\n1) Analyzes the progress of the testing activity.\n- It is illustrated in terms of percentages for the Pass/ Fail scenarios.\n2) Aids management to analyze and take future steps accordingly.\nWhat is Quality Center?\nIt is a web based application that enables and provides visibility and traceability to the entire testing process from the requirements to the test result analysis.\nFeatures of Quality Center\n1) Primary a Test Management Tool.\n2) It provides/ offers an organized framework for testing applications.\n3) Helps in organizing various test documents and managing all phases of application testing process (This step also includes testing requirement specifications, Test Plans). The activities that are supported are creating test requirements, planning for tests, execution of tests, and tracking related defects.\nThe main advantage is the ability to integrate all the tasks involved in testing (for application), hence we derive the maximum benefit of the best quality products.\n4) Ability to access your testing assets anytime, anywhere via a browser interface. (Accessibility is provided by means of username, password).\n5) Ability to create an end-to-end quality management infrastructure\nThe Quality Management infrastructure necessarily means\n- Requirements\n- TEst Cases\n- Test Results\n- Test Analysis Reports\n6) Manage manual and automated tests.\n- Manual tests can be accessed by opening the script and testing the same. Results are provided manually.\n- Automated test scripts can be referenced and the outcome can be indicated based on the outcome of the script result.\n7) Analyze application readiness at any point in the testing process with integrated graphs and reports.\nRequirements in Quality Center?\nWhat are requirements?\nAccording to the definition, the requirements includes all those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users. In short, this is what the client ultimately wants.\nRequirements can be stated in any of the following forms\n- SRS \u2013 System Requirement Specifications\n- URS \u2013 Users Requirement Specifications.\nRequirements can be added by selecting Requirements from the left panel.\nTest Plans\nIt is a facility through which the user will be able to add test cases, arrange and categorize those test cases, based on need.\nWhat is required for inserting/ creating test cases into Quality Center?\n1) In orderr to add the relevant test cases into QC, we need to create testcases in the format typical for QC update (compatible to QC).\n2) The test case is identified by three (3) parameters\n- Subject (The details indicated under the SUBJECT will enable QC to segregate based on the first level hierarchy. E.g. It may well be your client name say \u201cClient1\u201d). Client1\\Regression\\Phase2\n- TestName (Will consider the last level in the hierarchy to classify and store the related test cases. E.g. It may be a test scenario called \u201cOffline\u201d). Client1\\Regression\\Phase2\\User Access\n- Description (Will be an inherent part of the test case and will be visible when the user opens the test case through the test lab.\nExample of a description column entry\n- Objective : Verifying the Login feature to the application.\n- Username : admin\n- Password : n13da\n- Precondition : The user should have invoked the application on any of the browsers IE7, IE8, FireFox, Google Chrome.\n- Remarks (if any) :\nHow are test cases written?\na) Test cases are written in Excel in the format indicated below.\n- Subject\n- TestName\n- Description\n- StepName\n- Step Description\n- Expected Result\n- Designer\n- TestCase Status\n- Priority\nb) The \u201cTestCase Status\u201d column will have the entry \u201cDesign\u201d which is later change to \u201cReady to Execute\u201d.\nc) Test cases are always written in Excel and later uploaded into QC.\nd) As seen in the figure earlier, the Subject and TestName will identify the level of the test case.\ne) Ensure that the StepName is written sequentially as \u201cStep 0\u201d, \u201cStep 1\u201d, \u2026\nf) The Description contains\n- Objective\n- User details\n- PreCondition\n7 thoughts on \u201cUsing HP \u2013 Quality Center for Effective Testing\u201d\nVery useful blog! Keep it up.\nThanks\nSoftware Testing\nPlease let me know some unique features of QC apart from the basic flow.\nHi Andy,\nQC is an application that will enable the testers and the management to\n1) Track the execution of the test cases which are arranged and ordered in test suites.\n2) Enable the management to arrive at specific information from the metrics provided within QC.\n3) Enable the testers to effectively test and trace each and every test case within QC.\n4) Makes the testers job easier since it enables tracing from requirements to test suites/ test cases to defects. Defect ID in the form of URL from a defect tracking application can be copied and saved for each test case so that traceability exist when the user wants to know the reason for failure.\nThis blog is very useful. I want to know how to get a report of test cases wrote by a feature/folder and by a QA tester from QC 11 Test plan.\nThanks\nrao\n1. Open the project\n2. Display the \u201crequirements with coverage tests\u201d module\n3. Choose a report (Analysis >> Reports >> REquirements with coverage tests)\n4. Display the customization options. You can click the \u201cConfigure Reports and Sub-Reports\u201d button.\n5. Define a filter to view requirements created by a specific user name.\n6. Proceed to generate the report.\nhi sir i am ramkumar .i want into job testing\nI think the test cases are written according to the field available in the Test Management Tools.\nIn Microsoft Test Manager 2010, there are two fields.\n1.

    "context": "The global swine industry adopted early-weaning practices a generation ago. However, early weaned piglets have been characterized by poor growth performance, known as the \u201cpostweaning lag.\u201d A transient hypersensitivity response to new exposure to soy protein is one reason for the lag in post-weaning growth performance. Soybean meal (SBM) is commonly used as the primary protein source in pig diets. While some of the proteins in SBM are more easily digested, others can be quite difficult, especially for newly weaned piglets. The proteins that cause piglets the most problems include glycinin, which makes up about 40% of the total soybean protein, and \u03b2-conglycinin, which makes up about 30% of the total protein.\nThese soy proteins have been found to be allergenic within the intestinal lumen. Studies indicate that if an allergic reaction is mounted at the intestinal level, a local inflammation is generated, affecting protein and lipid metabolism and damaging the intestinal lining cells as shown by villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia which reduces nutrient absorption capacity. Some have also suggested that the proliferation of E. coli observed in the nursery phase may be more opportunistic due to these changes, rather than a primary cause. Moreover, unlike antinutritional factors present in SBM, thermal treatment in soybean does not alleviate glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin which exposes nursery piglets to risk. Considering that about 70% of the total soybean proteins are difficult for piglet digestion, it helps explain why a high inclusion of SBM in newly weaned piglet diets can lead to gut health issues often resulting in diarrhea and reduced growth performance. Therefore, SBM inclusion to newly weaned piglet diets is often limited, combining with other animal protein sources which do not contain anti-nutritional factors, such as fish meal, plasma proteins, and milk proteins. However, the digestibility benefits of such animal protein sources come at a cost, as they are more expensive than soybean meal.\nProtease Offers Solution:\nCIBENZA\u00ae DP100 enzyme feed additive is a broad range protease which hydrolyzes different protein substrates including glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin which can reduce the piglet\u2019s allergic response and help post-weaning growth performance. A study conducted by Novus International investigated the in vitro ability of protease to hydrolyze soybean glycinin and \u03b2- conglycinin and then evaluated the in vivo effects of protease on performance, intestinal morphology, and inflammatory response of nursery piglets fed corn-soybean diets with different crude protein concentrations. A saturated protease solution (1 ml) was added to two blank controls of either glycinin or \u03b2-conglycinin.\nThe in vitro study clearly demonstrated the ability of protease to hydrolyze glycinin and \u03b2- conglycinin (figure 1). While only 12% of the glycinin and 24% of the \u03b2-conglycinin were hydrolyzed in the control, 95% of the glycinin and 89% of the \u03b2-conglycinin were hydrolyzed in the incubations with added protease.\nFollowing the in vitro study, an in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the protease in hydrolyzing glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin and consequently reducing intestinal allergic reaction to soybean proteins. A total of 280 nursery piglets were fed two levels of soybean meal (15% and 30%) and protease was added to the diet with higher inclusion of soybean meal. After 21 days on diets, blood was collected from piglets to assess lymphocyte proliferation, which is used as an indicator of allergic reaction response. Piglets supplemented with protease, although fed high SBM diets, had reduced lymphocyte proliferation to piglets fed low SBM diets (figure 2). Results indicated that the allergic reaction to glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin was lower in piglets fed diets supplemented with protease. These results confirm that the hydrolysis of glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin observed in vitro was mimicked in vivo, reducing hypersensitivity to soybean protein.\nAnother in vivo experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of protease on intestinal inflammation, gut morphology and growth performance. A total of 190 nursery piglets were fed diets with or without protease. At the end of the three-week trial, blood was collected from piglets for assessment of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1; indicators of gut inflammation) and ileum samples were collected for morphometry assessment. Protease supplementation reduced (P < 0.01) the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 (Figure 3; same pattern observed for other pro-inflammatory cytokines), increased (P < 0.01) villus height and reduced (P = 0.08) crypt depth from ileum (Figure 4), which altogether indicates diminished intestinal inflammation for nursery piglets fed diets containing protease. As a result, daily gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved (P < 0.01; Figure 5, 6) by protease supplementation compared with those fed non-supplemented diets.",

    "answer": "Protease supplementation in the diet of nursery piglets fed with soybean meal reduces the piglet\u2019s allergic response to difficult-to-digest soy proteins, glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, and helps improve post-weaning growth performance.

The research paper, titled \u201cEndometriosis and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease,\u201d was published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, an American Heart Association journal.\nThe team reviewed medical data of 116,430 women enrolled in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, taking into account alternative therapies for the treatment of the disease, including oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy. By the end of follow-up, endometriosis was diagnosed by surgical examination in 11,903 of all examined women.\nDuring the 20-year follow-up, scientists found that women with endometriosis were 1.35 times more likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery or coronary angioplasty procedure/stent, a higher risk (1.52) of myocardial infarction and 1.91 times more likely to develop chest pain (angina). Relative risk of coronary heart disease was highest among women ages 40 years or younger. Compared to patients without endometriosis in the same age group, those suffering from the condition were three times more likely to have a heart attack, chest pain, or need treatment for blocked arteries.\nResearchers also noted that surgical treatment for endometriosis could be involved in this higher risk for heart disease: Removing the uterus or ovaries (surgically-induced menopause) may increase the risk for heart disease, which may be more evident at younger ages. Moreover, the higher frequency of these specific surgeries and the earlier the age at surgery after endometriosis diagnosis can partially explain the association between endometriosis and coronary heart disease.\n\u201cIt is important for women with endometriosis \u2014 even young women \u2014 to adopt heart-healthy lifestyle habits, be screened by their doctors for heart disease, and be familiar with symptoms, because heart disease remains the primary cause of death in women,\u201d senior study author Stacey A.

Women with endometriosis were 1.35 times more likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery or coronary angioplasty procedure/stent, had a higher risk (1.52) of myocardial infarction and were 1.91 times more likely to develop chest pain (angina). The relative risk of coronary heart disease was highest among women ages 40 years or younger. Those suffering from the condition were three times more likely to have a heart attack, chest pain, or need treatment for blocked arteries compared to patients without endometriosis in the same age group.",

    "context": "Basically, the Israel-Palestine conflict boils down poorly done planning by the Imperial British government regarding the formation of a safe-haven for the systematically oppressed Jewish minority in Europe, during the early 20th century. Zionist: A person who supports the Jewish population\u2019s right to establish a Jewish state in the region of Palestine (known as Canaan in their holy book).In the late 1800\u2019s, the Zionist movement began to erupt in Europe creating a revival in Jewish nationalism. Consequently, the British Secretary of Foreign Affairs declared British consent in the formation of a Jewish state in Palestine. As one would imagine, the Palestinians were not happy with this arrangement.\nEventually, In 1947, the British government transferred the situation unto the United Nation\u2019s jurisdiction. The UN then decided implement the Partition Plan which decreased Palestinian land ownership by 78%.\nThe Partition Plan led to the forced migration of Palestinian natives out of their homeland, into the surrounding arab countries. This then caused a war between Israel and the surrounding arab countries, spanning from 1947-1949. Miraculously, the Israelites emerged victorious and began expanding their land further.\nIn 1967, Israel took control of the remaining 22% of Palestinian land: West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government began to implement laws which practically ostracized the Islamic-Palestinian community, making them second class citizens in the established Jewish state. Palestinians in Israel are not allowed to own land and are often unjustly incarcerated.\nThe conflict is still very much alive today. The United States government supplies the Israeli government with weaponry which they use to further oppress the palestinians and protect themselves from Islamic threats.\n\u201cIsrael receives about $3 billion in direct foreign assistance each year, which is roughly one-fifth of Americas entire foreign aid budget.\u201d\n\u2013 John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt, Authors of The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy\nThis global dispute is one of the most complicated and controvesial in the world today. Unfortunately, there will likely be no final resolution between Israel and Palestine in the foreseeable future. The best we can do is spread the word about this issue and make the populace care about global affairs.\nRead More Here:\nYour email address will not be published.

    "context": "Things you didn\u2019t know about your furnace\nAt a dinner this week in San Francisco, I found myself seated between Matt Golden, co-founder of energy efficiency retrofitter Recurve \u2014 the startup formerly known as Sustainable Spaces \u2014 and Cisco DeVries, co-founder of Renewable Funding, the Oakland outfit that pioneered municipal financing of residential solar arrays.\nThe hot topic was Home Star \u2014 aka Cash for Caulkers \u2014 the proposed $6 billion federal energy efficiency rebate program now wending its way through Congress. The bill is being cast as a way to fight climate change, lower energy bills for 3.3 million homes and create an estimated 168,000 sustainable green jobs in a recession-wracked nation.\nNo surprise that a coalition of environmentalists, labor groups, and businesses have hitched their star to Home Star, including Home Depot, Dow Chemical, the Sierra Club, and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.\nAbout $3.6 billion of Home Star cash would be devoted to \u201cSilver Star,\u201d a program designed to quickly roll out basic energy efficiency improvements by providing up to $3,000 in rebates per household for such things as insulation and sealing doors and windows.\nThe Gold Star part of the program offers $3,000 for every 20 percent in energy savings that result from retrofits, up to a maximum of $8,000. Under Gold Star, homeowners could undertake more extensive energy efficiency retrofits as well as install renewable energy systems such as solar arrays.\nBoth programs would cap the rebates at 50 percent of a project\u2019s cost.\n\u201cThis program is designed to rapidly create jobs but also a long-term American industry,\u201d Golden said a couple days after the dinner during a press conference held in advance of Congressional hearings Thursday. \u201cWe have an opportunity to contribute to energy independence and meet our climate goals. The construction industry is in the realm of a Depression. These are 100 percent American jobs.\u201d\nIt\u2019s winning rhetoric but what I wanted to know was this: with billions of dollars in federal subsidies potentially flooding the energy efficiency market, how do you ensure that retrofits are done properly and that the climate change dividend gets paid?\nTalk to old-timers who lived through various solar subsidy programs back in the 1970s and \u201980s and they\u2019ll bemoan the shoddy operators that tried to cash in on the market, giving legitimate companies a bad name.\nGolden takes pains to emphasize that Home Star energy efficiency retrofits will be audited to ensure \u201cthe American taxpayer is getting their money\u2019s worth.\u201d\nThe details of those audits remain to be worked out but some high-tech tools could help make sure those caulking guns shoot straight.\nOver the past year there\u2019s been a proliferation of home energy management software from companies like Google and Microsoft as well as startups such as AlertMe and Tendril.\nNew Microsoft Hohm software provides real time data on home energy useThe idea behind services like Microsoft\u2019s Hohm and Google\u2019s PowerMeter is to give homeowners data \u2014 in real time for those whose utilities have hooked up smart meters \u2014 on their energy use. That way they can pinpoint where they may be wasting electrons, whether through bad habits or electricity-hogging appliances, and adjust their behavior accordingly.\nI asked Microsoft executive Troy Batterberry whether Hohm could play a role in Home Star to monitor electricity usage before and after a retrofit and quantify the energy savings from various improvements.\n\u201cAbsolutely and it\u2019s a question we get from our utility partners,\u201d said Batterberry, who runs the Hohm program. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have mountains of data that we can use to verify, say, what the expected savings will be when a person puts in a new high efficiency heat pump or air conditioner.\u201d\n\u201cHome Star could ignite the use of this type of tool,\u201d he added.\nSuch programs could also come in handy in helping retrofit firms identify energy hogs in a home.\nDan Reicher, director of climate change and energy program\u2019s for Google.org \u2014 the search giant\u2019s philanthropic arm \u2014 discovered that feature of the company\u2019s PowerMeter energy management software when he began using it at his home.\n\u201cLiterally with PowerMeter, everyone discovers something about their home they didn\u2019t know about,\u201d Reicher told me during a recent visit to Google\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. \u201cIn my case I had an old gas furnace but decided that given we don\u2019t have a lot of cold weather around here it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for me to replace it. What I didn\u2019t realize was that the furnace had an ancient electric motor.\u201d\nOnce Reicher started using PowerMeter he began to notice spikes in his home\u2019s electricity usage every time the furnace came on. After some investigation he discovered the culprit was the old inefficient motor that pushed hot air through the house\u2019s ductwork.\nSuch data could help make those Home Star dollars go even further by providing at least a partial roadmap of a home\u2019s energy efficiency weak spots before the guys and gals with the caulking guns show up at the front door. And assure taxpayers that their dollars are well spent.\nDonate now to support our work.",

    "context": "Proposed Re-Brand (Commercial)\nUnused\nThis is a series of infographics I designed and illustrated based on the new wearable technology that is available to consumers. 5 different types of professions/people we chosen to illustrate just how much of this Tech is out there and what it could be used for. We tried to get as broad a range as we could to help illustrated this point.\nIn 2014 I designed a series of posters as a present for my parents, who had just bought a new flat in London. I wanted to depict the new London and it\u2019s evolving skyline. The idea was that these images would age as they lived in the flat. These buildings would change from new London to old London.\nThese have been featured on a number of blogs including: waaaat?, Feel Design, Sky High City, fubiz and others. They were also featured in a Mexican Design publication called Fahreniheit.\nThis was a self-initiated project I completed in 2016. The brief was simple, design an app that I would want.\nThe app itself is a walking tour guide for the breweries in London. Using predetermined tours from the libraries you could navigate you way around London\u2019s many breweries, pubs and beers.\nI used this project as an excuse to design an app; something I had always wanted to do. Although I never intended to put it on the app store, I wanted to understand how they were made and learn about UI design. I started with sketched wire-frames and worked it all the way up to the final design. Creating everything for this app was a lot of fun and opened my eyes to new ways of working. Although I have much to learn about app design, I really enjoyed working on this and hope to do more in the future.\nOn the next few pages are some of the various infographics I have worked on during my time at PHA Media.\nI was set the task of designing the Logo and Brand Guidelines for a start up Lifestyle store called Audreystyle. This logo was used as the basis for creating the social media identity and website design.\nThis is the artwork for a new single called Sky Rocket by Phoebe Ray being released in 2016.\nI worked closely with the artist on the project but was give the freedom to explore the song and its lyrics to create the final artwork.\nI also created a number of social media posts and profile imagery.\nThis one of a series of documents called \u2018Insights\u2019 I have created while working for PHA Media. Each has a unique topic and associated look. These documents are used to help clients, both current and prospective, understand what PR is and how to make it work in your advantage.\nFor each I was used different illustrative styles to fit the topic described. This allowed me to try a number of different styles and techniques.\nIn both 2014 & 2015 I submitted illustrations for the annual Secret 7\u201d completion. In this you are asked to create work based on\none of 7 songs they select.\nMy work was selected for the final exhibition in both years.\nIn 2015 I was asked to re-brand Hip Joint Surgery, a Consultant Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeon. For this he required a new logo and website.\nI used a subtle curve on the H in Hip to imply the shape of the hips and took the clean style right across the brand. This lead on to designing the website where we had to make the functionality simple for his elder clients as well as attract new ones.\nThis was my submission for the Catit art competition in 2015.

We present a cheap multilevel solver for partition of unity discretizations of any order. The shape functions of a PUM are products of piecewise rational partition of unity (PU) functions and higher order local approximation functions (usually a local polynomial. Furthermore, they are non-interpolatory. In a multilevel approach we not only have to cope with non-interpolatory basis functions but also with a sequence of nonnested spaces due to the meshfree construction. Hence, injection or interpolatory interlevel transfer operators are not available for our multilevel PUM. Therefore, the remaining natural choice for the prolongation operators are L2-projections. Here, we exploit the partition of unity construction of the function spaces and a hierarchical construction of the PU itself to localize the corresponding projection problem. This significantly reduces the computational costs associated with the setup and the application of the interlevel transfer operators. The second main ingredient for our multilevel solver is the use of a block-smoother to treat the local approximation functions simultaneously. The results of our numerical experiments in two and three dimensions show that the convergence rate of the proposed multilevel solver is independent of the number of patches. The convergence rate is slightly dependent on the local approximation orders.} }",

    "context": "The Internet of Things (IoT) wave will soon wash over Australia\u2019s small to medium enterprises.\nThe Internet of Things, or IoT, is basically the idea of making non-connected devices in our environment connected to us, or each other. For two generations we\u2019ve worked with computers using screens and keyboards, but the future where it involves IoT leaves that paradigm. Smart and connected devices don\u2019t require screens to talk to us, or to each other.\nIn the early days of computing, people like Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were \u201cmakers\u201d, using technologies the Altair 8800 to make computing software, and CPUs like the Intel 8080 to make computer-enabled electronics.\nAfter two to three decades of \u201cdoing\u201d using mass-produced and general-purpose hardware and software, \u201cmaking\u201d is happening again with low-cost access to the Internet, WiFi, and computing with ready-made micro-computers such as the Raspberry Pi, C.H.I.P, Intel Edison, and the cloudBit.\nWith less than $100, you or I can add connected computing technology to something that was previously unconnected, like a doorbell.\nDepending on where you position yourself and your business, that could be a wave of opportunity, a wave of data, a wave of disruption or a wave of security breaches.\nAlong with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology, IoT threatens to shake up our world much like the Internet did between 1996 and 2009, where new jobs were born, many made redundant, and start-ups like Facebook, Google and Twitter emerged from dorm rooms and basements into world mega-companies.\nAs a distant projection we can imagine nanobots who \u201clive\u201d in your clothes that can repair your wear and tear, change the colour of the cloth and even modify your clothes according to the data of your scales/health monitors. As with anything in our world however, cost is the main driver and in the SME world it will be the small things that make a big difference that will change first.\nAn example of a likely use in SMEs would be fleet cars/trucks. Already available through Satellite tech, we may soon see the technology become cheaper using the Internet and having our cars join the Internet of Things. Or perhaps the fuel tanks of our fleet cars, or their safety cams.\nAt this point, as a SME owner I could learn a lot about how my company cars are being used, where they are going and get indicators of how long they will last or how regularly they need to be serviced. As a tool manufacturer, my plant equipment can inform me when a part is about to fail or requires service. As a caf\u00e9 owner, my storage tubs could report when a threshold of bacteria has been reached, requiring food to be tossed out ahead of schedule.\nIoT will start where it\u2019s cheap to implement and provides maximum benefit, and gradually backfill through our world to where it becomes ubiquitous. If it hasn\u2019t already struck you, the security implications are monstrous.\nIt would be nice to have my PC hard drive IoT enabled, to report to me or my backup software that it predicts a failure in itself. Of course, an IoT hard drive is connected to the Internet, putting all of my data at risk. What would be at risk if my insurance company, my government, other governments, criminal gangs or my former partners could access everything on my hard drive?\nThankfully those behind IoT are thinking ahead, and trying to create IoT \u201cthings\u201d that have \u201cbaked-in\u201d security, national or international standards of a sliding scale so people can make informed decisions without an in-depth technical knowledge of IT and IoT security.\nThe other mind-bending change coming from IoT is data. The amount of data we\u2019re likely to produce in the next two decades will be exponentially more than in previous history. Big Data is going to get really big now, as millions, then billions of \u201cthings\u201d around the world begin to report to millions of databases.\nSo where does Diamond fit into all of this?\nThe closest thing we sell to IoT right now is smart phones. Our iPhones and Android phones are early examples of IoT, although true IoT of the future will be mostly without a display or human interface. One key area of security relating to IoT is already valid.\nThe big change coming that relates to Diamond is the security of outgoing data. One of the main advantages of modern Unified Threat Management devices (UTM) is that they are capable of monitoring where traffic is going, where it came from and what\u2019s in the data. In the past much of the data from SMEs has been coming in, but IoT will further increase the traffic going out, and it will need to be protected, restricted and monitored.\nA UTM is already useful for monitoring people, applications and potential threats from PCs and servers and smart phones, and will become a necessity going forward as IoT becomes commonplace.\nWe have a fascinating future ahead of us with these emerging techs, perhaps the biggest explosion of knowledge the world is yet to see. The security and privacy challenges ahead of us are huge, but we humans will adapt and learn as we always have and see some mind-boggling changes in our lifetime..",

For example, IoT could allow a business owner to learn more about how their company cars are being used, or a caf\u00e9 owner could be alerted when a threshold of bacteria has been reached in their storage tubs. However, it also presents security implications, as connected devices could potentially put data at risk.",

That\u2019s exactly what Toyota did in February 2005 by discontinuing the Qualis multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) and launching a bigger, more luxurious MPV, the Innova.\nFrom Qualis to Innova\nThe Qualis was introduced in January 2000, and by the time the company discontinued this rather ordinary-looking MPV in December 2004, a cumulative 1,42,500 units were sold. According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the Qualis\u2014which competed with Tata Sumo and Mahindra Bolero, among others\u2014was instrumental in increasing the market share of the MPV segment in the industry from less than 9% to over 11%.\nSales averaged over 2,000 units per month and, contrary to popular perception, only 30% sales went to the taxicab segment. The decision to launch the Innova\u2014MPVs were all about \u2018value\u2019, the Innova introduced \u2018luxury\u2019 in the segment\u2014was part of an international project to develop a single platform on which new models will be built.\nFrom 2005 to 2016\nLaunched in February 2005, the Innova was a runaway success, even at then what was a hefty price tag for an MPV\u2014from Rs 6.75 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Toyota sold 5,78,014 units in 11 years\u2014averaging over 4,000 units every month. What competitors didn\u2019t quite understand was how could a brand maintain its appeal for over a decade without the manufacturer making too many changes to it. A few improvements Toyota introduced were the addition of an intercooler (2009), a minor facelift (2011), and a second minor facelift (2014).\nHarish Bijoor, brand expert & founder, Harish Bijoor Consults, says that the strong brand value of the Innova is courtesy its Indianness. \u201cIn many ways, the Innova is a \u2018made for India\u2019 car. It\u2019s big, rugged and spacious. It\u2019s a \u2018two plus two plus two car\u2019, as I would call it,\u201d he says, adding that it was finally a replacement for the long-dying Ambassador. \u201cIt took on the legacy of the Ambassador. The bureaucracy adopted it just as much as the fleet owners embraced it.\u201d\nIt did face competition\u2014Mahindra Xylo, Chevrolet Tavera, Nissan Evalia, Renault Lodgy\u2014but none could challenge its dominance. With the Ertiga, Maruti Suzuki managed to outsell the Innova every once in a while, but then the Ertiga was a cheaper, entry-level MPV. Again, contrary to popular perception, the Innova was primarily sold in the personal segment (70%), not commercial\u2014which has higher \u2018visibility\u2019, thus the perception.\nThe Delhi diesel ban\nIn December 2015, the Supreme Court, in a move to clean up the city\u2019s filthy air, imposed a ban on registration of diesel vehicles of engine capacity 2000cc and above in Delhi NCR, until March 31, 2016. As much as 8% of Innova sales, or 700 units per month, evaporated\u2014it had a 2494cc diesel engine. N Raja, director & senior vice-president, Sales & Marketing, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, says that the company supported local dealers by taking back the inventory and providing salaries to the affected sales staff.\nFrom Innova to Crysta\nIn May 2016, the company drove in the Innova Crysta, this time with two diesel engine options\u2014the 2393cc with manual transmission and 2755cc with automatic. Price increase was to the tune of a considerable Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh and the Delhi diesel ban continued, yet sales shot up. By the time the company launched a petrol version\u20142694cc\u2014in August, the Innova Crysta already had sold over 24,000 units and had a pending order of 9,000 units. A new sales trend ensued\u2014from the earlier 70% sales that went into the personal segment, it increased to over 95%. Another trend was that 50% of Innova Crysta sales were those of automatic transmission, reflecting the changing customer preference.\nReasons behind success\nRaja says it has a low cost of ownership, its engine life is the best in the segment, and resale value is high. \u201cA three-year-old Innova, for example, doesn\u2019t lose more than 30% of its original price when you retail it in the second-hand market.\u201d\nAgrees Hormazd Sorabjee, the editor of Autocar India magazine. \u201cIn the MPV segment, success is more due to practical considerations than emotional ones. The Innova has an unbeatable reputation for reliability, quality and a strong resale value\u2014the most important criteria for MPV buyers. It also has a 5-lakh-strong customer base and many of them are ready to upgrade to the new Innova\u2014this serves as a ready market that no other MPV has.\u201d\nFrom Crysta to Touring Sport\nEarlier this month, Toyota launched yet another variant\u2014the Innova Touring Sport from Rs 17.79 lakh to Rs 22.15 lakh. It gets an all-black front grille, smoked chrome headlamps and front bumper spoiler, giving this MPV an SUV-like styling. For the first time, customers have the choice of a sporty avatar.\nHefty pricing hasn\u2019t slowed down sales. In one year, the Innova Crysta has sold 85,475 units (over 7,000 units every month). Bijoor says it\u2019ll keep scripting new success stories, even though the new pricing has pitted it against entry-luxury cars. \u201cToyota is investing in nudging the brand image higher in the pecking order, and is evolving the brand as India itself climbs up the hierarchy of needs in its choice of cars.\u201d\nvikram.chaudhary@expressindia.com",

This is similar to a copy and paste; however, by creating a shortcut of an asset, an asset can be duplicated on a site, and editing the properties of one version of the asset will affect all versions of that asset throughout the entire site. So, if you place a shortcut of an article on three locations on a site, editing just one version of that article will render changes on all three.\nTo\ncreate a shortcut of an asset, locate the asset toolbar of the asset\nyou\u2019d like to duplicate. In this case, the \u201cWelcome\u201d article of\nthe WebGUI demo page will be duplicated.\nThe shortcut button is at the far right hand side of the asset toolbar and resembles a curving arrow.\nTo create the shortcut, click on the shortcut arrow. A new tab, the Clipboard tab, will appear in the Admin Bar, containing the asset shortcut. The asset\u2019s title will be displayed, so if there are multiple items in the clipboard you will be able to tell what is what.\ngo to the page on which you\u2019d like to place the copy of the asset.\nIn this example, a copy of the \u201cWelcome\u201d article will be placed\non a new page layout.

This will allow you to change the properties of the shortcut, but will not affect the properties of any other version of the shortcut asset on the site.\nIf you look at the shortcut of the \u201cWelcome\u201d article, you will notice that there are two toolbars: a shortcut toolbar and the asset toolbar. The shortcut toolbar is the upper toolbar, above the gray bar with the \u201cShortcut\u201d heading; hovering your mouse over the furthest icon to the left will reveal this.\nTo illustrate override options, a shortcut of a news section will be made.

The creator of this asset would like a shortcut of the news section to appear on the site\u2019s homepage, but only wants four of the threads to be visible on the homepage, as opposed to the full eight. In this case, an override of the asset\u2019s original properties will be made in the shortcut.\nIn\nthis example, the shortcut of the news section will be place below\nthe \u201cWelcome\u201d article of the Plain Black demo homepage.\nAll\neight headlines are currently displayed in the asset shortcut, and\nthe desired outcome is to only display 4 of those threads on the\npage. To change this, the properties of the shortcut will need to be\noverridden. To do so, locate the shortcut toolbar, and click its Edit\nbutton. This will open the \u201cEdit Shortcut\u201d screen.\nClick\non the \u201cOverrides\u201d tab to open the override screen.

She hated her mom dating Don Masters. Not only because he is Adriana's dad but because she could tell there was something not right with him. He's a player, she can feel it.

With Loren's help, his record label was getting what they wanted and he was having fun writing songs. He saw her walk up with foam cooler. That was their deal; he brings the guitar, she brings the food. He quickly checked his breath and stood up to take the cooler from her.\n\"Hey Loren,\" he said hugging her, \"have fun at work?\"\n\"Yeah because I love dealing with stuck up rich kids from school and smelling like coffee all the time.\" They laughed.\n\"You smell fine. Ready to get started?\"\n\"Yeah, but I have to leave early today.\" She said sitting down.\n\"What why?\"\n\"Well, tonight is my 3 month anniversary with Cam.\"\n\"Oh, okay.\" He didn't know why but this really bothered him. He didn't like Cam. Something about him just rubbed him the wrong way and he would be damned to see him hurt Loren.\nFor the next few hours they laughed and wrote lyrics to their new song. It seemed like 10 minutes went by when Melissa called Loren.\n\"Hey Mel you're on speaker\"\n\"WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?\"\n\"I'm songwriting with Eddie why?\"\n\"It's 5:00! You were supposed to be here half an hour ago!\"\n\"Shit, I'll be there in 5 minutes.\"\nShe hung up the phone and picked up her stuff, \"This was fun Eddie. See you tomorrow?\"\n\"Yeah have fun on your date.\" He said with a half smile. He watched her walk away and wished she would stay. He looked out and saw the sun start to set.\n'Why does this bother me so much?' he thought.\nHe picked up his car keys and drove to his dad's club. He needed to talk to someone.\n\"Hey Eddie\" Max said ad Eddie walked in the door.\n\"Hey, pop\" Eddie said, \"I need to talk to you.\" With that Eddie said everything on his mind. When he was finished his dad was smiling at him with an eyebrow raised.\n\"Son, you're jealous\" Max said.\n\"No dad, she's just a friend.\"\n\"Please, you always talk about her, want to spend time with her. You hate it when she's with any other guy. She's been there for you since you and Chloe broke up. It's normal that you developed feelings.\"\nEddies looked at his dad, \"Shit\" he said. His dad handed him a beer and his phone vibrated.\n\"Loren just tweeted a photo of her and Cameron at the top of the Ferris wheel.\" He said turning his phone off.\n\"Go home son, it's late.\" Max said putting a hand on Eddie's back.

    "context": "Miguel Hidalgo, Mexican Independence\nMiguel Hidalgo is one of the most recognized characters in the movement for Mexicos Independence. His full name was Miguel Gregorio Antonio Ignacio Hidalgo y Costilla y Gallaga Mondarte, born in Guanajuato in the town of Penjamo on the 8 of May, 1753. His parents were Ana Maria Gallaga and Cristobal Hidalgo y Costilla, both Spanish.\nHe studied at Colegio de San Nicolas Obispo, where he continued to become a professor on topics like philosophy and theology, culminating with theSchools rectory. He was ordained in 1792 and sent to Dolores Hidalgo.\nBack then, the ideas of liberalism had permeated among the Creole class of New Spain, movement joined by the priest of Dolores and consolidating in the conspiracy of Quer\u00e9taro struggling for Mexicos independence.\nThis is how one of the most important episodes in the countrys history began, although many other characters have remained almost anonymous even though they contributed resources and organization in support of the movement,Hidalgo is recognized for having reacted together with others such as Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Mariano Abasolo, among others, to the call of Do\u00f1a Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez who warned that the conspiracy had been discovered.\nThis is how, with the power to call others, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla on the morning of September 15 in 1810 summoned the town to start the movement that would give Mexico its independence, even though he didnt live to see its culmination.\nThe movements first advance, however, is owed to Hidalgo and military men, their troops left Dolores, reached Atotonilco in San Miguel de Allende, then known as El Grande, directing towards Celaya, Salamanca and finally Guanajuato.\nAt the Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas there was another confrontation between the Spanish and insurgent troops, the first were defeated, so Miguel Hidalgo went on to Valladolid, which was also among the most important places taken back then. Valladolid is important because thats where they planned overtaking the Capital of New Spain, where all the central powers were represented.\nAlong his path, on August 30 in 1810, the battle of Monte de las Cruces took place, already close to the capital, where he was triumphant, however, this gave Hidalgo an excess confidence and sent his troops to Ixtlahuaca, wasting the weakness he had left in the city.\nHis plan was to attack the realist troops by surprise and to not confront them in the capital, which lead to a confrontation at Puente Calder\u00f3n, where he didnt gain an advantage, returning to the countrys north. Along his path, at Acatita de Bajan, he and his troops suffered an ambush because their route had been announced to realist troops, making them prisoners.\nThe date of his detention was registered in history as the 21st of May in 1811, when they were taken to Chihuahua, where they would first execute Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Mario Jimenez, on June 16 of that same year. Hidalgo was executed later, on July 30 of 1811. However, the struggles and ideals of the leaders were not forgotten and although their armed battle culminated in 1821, the figure of the Priest of Dolores continues to be transcendental for its meaning and the way he strengthened the struggle for independence.\nFor many, Hidalgo wasnt the historys hero known by almost everyone, however, and despite his detractors, for Mexicans the leaders who made independence possible are kept away from critics and secret history; they are venerated for the great value of freedom in an independent country.\nArt\u00edculo Producido por el Equipo Editorial Explorando M\u00e9xico.\nFoto: Wikipedia.org",

And, if a larger bank acquires UCPB, we expect that UCPB\u2019s credit quality would benefit from the support of its new majority shareholder,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a statement.\nLast week, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III disclosed that the Department of Finance (DOF) will soon start privatizing UCPB, after the Supreme Court (SC) lifted this month the halt order it had issued to implement Executive Order (EO) No. 180 signed by former president Benigno Aquino III.\nTo recall, the SC put on hold in June 2015 the implementation of EO Nos. 179 and 180, which would have set into motion the privatization and reconveyance to the government of about P74.3 billion in coco levy funds that the high court earlier declared as public funds.\nAccording to Moody\u2019s, \u201cif the privatization and recapitalization are successful, the new equity capital will support UCPB\u2019s growth and maintain its minimum Tier 1 capital ratio above a 10-percent requirement that includes a capital conservation buffer required for all Philippine banks.\u201d\nAlso, Moody\u2019s noted that \u201cin contrast to the government, UCPB\u2019s eventual new majority shareholder likely will view UCPB as a strategic addition to its domestic operations.\u201d\nAs such, Moody\u2019s said it expects that \u201cthe new shareholder will support UCPB, a credit positive for UCPB\u2019s depositors and creditors.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough no details have been released by either the government or the bank, we expect the terms of the recapitalization plan by first-quarter 2018, shortly after the government and the bank restart the planning work that was done during the last privatization attempt,\u201d Moddy\u2019s said.\n\u201cMr. Dominguez said that the recapitalization program for UCPB should be pursued quickly because the government does not intend to extend the financial assistance for the bank beyond the expiration of the rehabilitation plan at the end of 2018,\u201d it added.\nDue to the earlier temporary restraining order issued by the SC, the Privatization and Management Office (PMO) announced in July 2015. /kga\nSubscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

Oh gosh! The thought of it made me fumed! I thought acne only occurs in adolescent and not adults?\nRecently with the results of my cleanser's pH testing, it made me wonder why the huge variant in pH readings between Ettusais Medicated Soap (pH9) and The Body Shop Tea Tree Facial Wash (pH6) which I have been diligently using for the pass 6 months.\nI usually uses TBS Tea Tree Facial Wash for morning, as I find it less harsh and more moisturising. As for Ettusais Medicated Soap, it for use at night, right after proper cleansing oil method. Somehow the Ettusais manages to leave my skin real clean but rather drying which I quickly hydrate with my Vichy Thermal Facial Mist (I am horrified that it has a pH9, which I will be discussing more in my next post). Its really horrible to think of how much my skin has to recover to pH5.5 after using the Ettusais Medicated Soap. And it made me realised now, how important it is to apply the Ettusais Acne Version Up (pH6) and Ettusais Acne Aqua Shooter (pH5) immediately instead of Vichy Thermal Facial Mist! I cant imagine the amount of bacteria multiplying on my face! Oh yucks!!!\nI came across Beauty Credit skin shower story promoting cleansers with pH8.8. This really confuses and contradict my previous findings from ezinearticles.com\nSomething caught my eye while my brain is trying to logic it out. Cleansers with pH < 5.5 is moisturising but poor cleansing power. Didn't I just review the TBS Tea Tree Facial Wash, commenting that it was less harsh and very moisturising? The main reason why I hate to use it after makeup removal is because it leaves a layer of silky feeling which I find it does not cleanses well. But its great to use it in the morning. Next, cleansers with pH > 8.8 has stronf cleansing power yet causes dryness. Yes! That is exactly what Ettusais Medicated Soap did! It made my skin so dry that prompted me use facial mist.\nDespite the table of benefit on cleanser with pH8.8, I seriously need to test it before I can say it works! I am very tempted to buy it yet rather hesitant about cleansers with pH > 8.00. Any advise from readers using Beauty Credit Skin Shower pH8.8? Pls share your review with us by leaving your link at the comments.\n1 comments:\nThere are a lot of views on skincare, just like the age-old argument about moisturisers and oily skin. Some believe that you should reduce or even do away with moisturisers if you have oily skin, while others claim that you need to moisturise more so that your skin won't need to produce more oil to do the job.\nFor the pH level issue, Somang Korea figured that it's pointless to have a super-gentle cleanser that sacrifices cleaning power. Somang can't claim that pH 8.8 is the \"best\" pH level, but based on their research it is the most \"balanced\" when tested on a majority of people.\nMy advice is the same for anyone who asks me if such-and-such skincare is right for them - try it yourself first. We have testers available for (almost) every product at all our stores, and some we even have sample sachets for you to try at home. Please check with our staff for availability first, though. - Beauty Credit",

But I\u2019ve left restaurant jobs before, it\u2019s always such a pain in the ass showing up at a new place, trying to make a good first impression, starting over somewhere else from the bottom.\nAnd yeah, I don\u2019t necessarily like complaining, but every once in a while it\u2019ll just build up, all of those little interactions at work, constantly getting micromanaged by people that you see every day, only at work, this cast of characters in my life that serve no other purpose than to direct me from point A to point B.\nI have a lot of energy. At work, I don\u2019t even necessarily try, but I move around the restaurant pretty quickly.

Rob, get me another roll of printer paper.\u201d After a while I start to feel like, the faster and more efficient that I complete every one of these little tasks, all I\u2019m doing is making more work for myself. Restaurant bosses hate to see their employees standing idle for even a second. And so, as soon as I open up my mouth to start small-talk with a coworker, a manager is guaranteed to show up, to interrupt me midsentence, \u201cRob, can you make sure that the silverware is polished?\u201d\nYeah, I get the argument that there\u2019s virtue in work. Sure, I have this picture in my head of me marching around the world putting my best foot forward, giving everything that I do one hundred percent, just for the sake of giving it my all, a testament to my admirable work ethic.\nBut on a day-to-day basis, especially on days where I\u2019m not really feeling it, where I wish that I didn\u2019t have to still be waiting tables at a restaurant, running around, the expediter is telling me to back up ice, and on the way to the ice machine, a customer stops me in my tracks, he lifts up his soda glass and, in between bites of food, he says simply, \u201cMore Diet Coke,\u201d and on my way to get his refill, I\u2019ve got another two people in the kitchen looking directly at me, \u201cIs anybody backing up ice?\u201d obviously you just asked me to back up ice, obviously I don\u2019t have the ice, why are you forming it as this general question? Why don\u2019t you just give me a second and I\u2019ll back up ice?\nYeah, on days like that, it\u2019ll get to me, the ceaseless busy work, the realization that, the faster I move, the more work I\u2019ll ultimately have to do. And for what? A few dollars an hour? That\u2019s what really bugs me about restaurant work. The house isn\u2019t even paying me a living wage, and yet they\u2019re acting under the expectation that I\u2019m to work under their absolute obedience, the customers\u2019 absolute obedience, everybody in the restaurant is my boss, but the only ones contributing to my making a living are the people who, after they\u2019ve settled up with the house, maybe they\u2019ll throw me a tip. Probably. Almost definitely. But still, maybe. There\u2019s always the potential for a maybe not.\nAnd so what can I do? \u201cBoss, I gave table thirteen excellent service, but they didn\u2019t leave a tip.\u201d\n\u201cOh well, better luck next time.

    "context": "By David Bakke\nDavid Bakke writes about money topics like saving money, planning for retirement, smart shopping, and building wealth on the Money Crashers personal finance blog.\nIf your employer offers an individual 401k retirement plan, you should be contributing to it unless you fall into a very small exception category. The only time I would advise against participating in a company-sponsored 401k plan is if these contributions would interfere with your ability to pay monthly bills or get out of debt. Don\u2019t invest in your future at the expense of your current situation. But if you can afford to make even a small contribution to the plan, go for it. Now that you're considering your personal retirement planning, let's address a crucial question: How much should you contribute to your 401k fund? Is 1% enough? Should it be 5%? Or 10%? Should the amount of your contribution depend on your age? Consider these five key factors.\n1. Your Company Match Offer\nMany companies will match your 401k contribution up to a certain limit. If possible, contribute at least as much as that limit. This company match is completely free money and you should take advantage of every penny of it. If you don't, you're leaving money on the table. The match limit varies, so check with your company to find out whether or not you are making the most of your 401k investment. Also, make sure you read the fine print: Don't be surprised if your company only matches half of your commitment. Many employers also require a minimum amount of service before their matching contributions are fully vested. If you want to consider contributions that exceed your company match limit, the benefits of your higher percentage contribution begin to drop significantly. At this point, you need to weigh the value of the additional 401k investment against the importance of funding other aspects of your life.\nThere is a limit on how much pre-tax income you can contribute to your 401k retirement plan. Maximum 401k contribution limits fluctuate from year to year, but currently, the limit set by the IRS is $16,500. Your employer may even opt to set a lower limit than that, and employer limits vary from company to company. I've seen them go as high as 20%, but normally, most companies set it around 10%. Some professionals advise that you should contribute the absolute maximum allowed under this rule. Find out your company's restrictions before you make a decision.\nSome say that the younger you are, the more you should contribute to your 401k. In essence, the contributions that you make at a younger age are more valuable than the ones you make as you grow older, thanks to the power of compound interest. However, keep in mind that money contributed to a 401k is less accessible than money invested in say, a Roth IRA account, where you can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalty. At a younger age, you may have greater need to spend money to further your education, buy a home, or make other stage-of-life investments. The value of liquidity is an important factor for you to weigh against the benefit of compound interest. Personally, I think your contribution level should depend more upon your current financial situation than on your age. Your actual income level, your current level of debt, and your plans for upcoming life events (and corresponding need for money) should all play a far greater role in your decision-making process.\nSince your 401k contribution percentage has a lot to do with your personal situation, you owe it to yourself to consider your mindset toward your money and risk, and other more subjective factors. There are two schools of thought to consider when determining the right contribution percentage. According to one philosophy, you can begin with a large contribution and scale your percentage back as you see fit. Alternatively, you can start small and raise your percentage as much as you can over time. There are two reasons I prefer the first method. First, it's human nature to set something in motion and then forget about it. When it comes to your 401k, by starting high, you choose to commit a significant portion of your income to your 401k plan and receive the maximum benefit from your company match program. In the event that you never tweak it again, you will not lose out on potential gain because you forgot to ramp up your percentage. Second, while some employers will allow you to change your percentage at any time, others will only allow it at certain times of the year. As a result, if you go with the \"start small\" plan, it might take you a long time to work your way up to your peak percentage because of limits on how often you can change this allocation.\nThe benefits of a higher contribution are easy to see in purely mathematical terms. I've spent a few minutes with an online 401k contribution calculator to illustrate this point for a sample situation. Here are the parameters:\n1. $50K salary\n2. Age 35\n3. Retirement age of 65\n4. 8% return on investment\n5. 25% tax bracket\nIn this example, increasing the contribution by just one percentage point would drop your monthly income by a mere $31, which is about $8 per week. Since you would be lowering your taxable income, your annual tax bill would decrease by about $125. So on an annual basis, roughly one-third of your increased 401k contribution would come right back to you at tax time. Are you ready for the big number? If you continue to make that additional monthly contribution until you retire, those contributions of eight dollars per week could grow to over $56,000, based on the 8% return on your investment. Say that a few times over in your head: fifty-six thousand dollars.\nIn the end, you can make this decision only after reviewing the facts of your current financial situation. And more importantly, as your life changes, you should reevaluate your contribution accordingly. There may be times in life when you\u2019ll have to lower your percentage, but hopefully there are just as many times when you can raise it or maintain a target level. Take a few minutes out of your day to think about your own 401k. Do you know your percentage contribution or how to change it? It's up to you to plan for your future, and although retirement may seem like it's a long way off, there will come a day when you'll be glad you did.",

    "context": "\u00ab Study Finds Playing Math Game Boosted Preschoolers Abilities | Main | Early-Education Teacher Training Programs Don't Measure Up, Analysis Says \u00bb\nMore Mississippi Children On Track at the End of Kindergarten Year\nMississippi, which has made early literacy an educational focal point, has good news to report on test scores for its kindergartners.\nThe children who started kindergarten in fall 2015 performed better on a test of early literacy compared to the previous year's kindergarten class. The children who were kindergarten students in fall 2014 were the first ones to take the state's new STAR Early Literacy Exam. The test is administered twice to kindergarten students, and is intended to give teachers an idea of what children know once they start school, and what they are able to do as they head to first grade.\nIn fall 2014, the average score was 501, and it rose to 680 by spring 2015. That's the equivalent of a child starting school recognizing most letters and their sounds, and leaving kindergarten having mastered the alphabet, letter-sound relationships, and simple words. Those students are called \"transitional readers,\" and that's where they are expected to be by the end of kindergarten.\nFor the most recent test administration, the average kindergarten score was 502 in fall 2015, but it rose to an average of 703 in spring 2016. That score is still in the transitional reader range, but state officials said the faster rate of growth showed that more students were mastering those early-literacy skills.\nThe target score for all kindergarten students is 681. In spring 2015, about 54 percent of children scored at or above that level. In spring 2016, about 63 percent met the benchmark\nThe state has been decidedly behind in preparing children for kindergarten for years, but these results suggest that may be changing, said Kim Benton, chief academic officer for the Mississippi Department of Education.\n\"Our schools' and teachers' focus on literacy is making a significant impact on student learning,\" she said in a statement released on June 16.\nMississippi is one of the newest states to claim a state preschool program, having launched a pilot program in 2014-15, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research, or NIEER, a think tank focused on early education. That year, the state served 4 percent of 4-year-olds, and Head Start served an additional 30 percent, according to NIEER. (Just less than a third, 29 percent, of Mississippi's children, live in poverty.)\nIt will be interesting to see if any future improvement is attributable to the new program at some point. In the meantime, it seems like plenty of kudos likely belong to the state's kindergarten teachers.\nWe encourage lively debate, but please be respectful of others.

I have been going crazy for pink nude shades lately, on my face as well as my lips, so this week's favourites reflect that.\nFist up is Essie nail polish in muchi muchi, a cute pale pink shade that I've loved wearing to work lately. I don't own too many Essie polishes due to my undying love for Barry M, but I love this colour and the bottle is already almost half empty.\nNext is a lipgloss in the form of Tanya Burr's Aurora, which is a gorgeous dusky pink that adds a nice natural rosy shine to my lips. The applicator on these lip glosses is the perfect shape to coat your lips in, I own two other shades in the range and they are definitely my new favourites!\nAnother lip product that's made it's way into my favourites is my new Maybelline ColorSensation lipstick in Tantalising Taupe, from the Stripped Nudes collection. The formula of these lipsticks are, in my opinion, superior to most other drugstore lipsticks - they are easily on the same level quality wise as some high end counterparts and for only a fraction of the price! The colour payoff (ugh dat phrase!) is excellent, I can see myself investing in this entire collection eventually! This shade looks particularly good with a smokey eye, and has a dewy sheen finish.\nLastly there is an old favourite that I have rediscovered, the beautiful Autograph Highlighting powder. This is just so pretty to look at, and I have been sweeping it over my cheeks and lightly down my nose - where ever would usually catch the light - and the result is fantastic. This is a product that would probably go unnoticed my many because it is a lesser talked about brand in terms of make up, but I cannot recommend it enough, it's lovely!\nHave you tried any of these products? What have you been loving this week? xx\nI have Tantalising Taupe and I love it!

    "context": "Description\nWe\u2019ve seen in the scriptures that a Peaceful Heart leads to a healthy body. Colossians 3 says that we are to set our sights and focus on the things of heaven which will take our focus off the things of the earth which allows us to let the peace of God rule our hearts. What\u2019s interesting is he lists the \u201cthings of the earth\u201d and it\u2019s not what you might think. When we set our sights on heaven it will require us to put off or let go of anger, wrath, malice, malicious behavior (unforgiveness and judgement toward others). It helps us to put off our old sinful nature that we used to live by and put on our NEW nature.\nNotice it\u2019s something we do, not something God does for us. We have to make that choice, \u201cPut.\u201d\nIn order for us to allow God\u2019s Peace to rule in our hearts we must first do what he says as listed in the verses above. When we do, we will have a Peaceful Heart that God promises will lead to a healthy body. I don\u2019t know about you, but it sounds good just thinking about it. Can you imagine living a life of Peace and Health? I can.\nWhen the Lord led me to start Endless Possibilities a healing class at Ponce Church I decided that I would share and teach only what He was leading me to teach. What I\u2019m finding out based on the content He has given me is this: Yes, He has provided healing for us when He sent Jesus to die on the Cross. But he has also been emphasizing the importance of forgiving others and how it can affect the healing that Jesus has provided. The more I listen in prayer and study of the scriptures I am finding that forgiveness and healing are connected. The Cross is all about forgiveness and mercy and thank God for it. But if we decide others that have offended us are not worthy of forgiveness then we have entered into judgement. And the scriptures say, \u201cFor you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.\u201d Matthew 7:2. And if we have lived our life holding others sins against them then we are no longer walking in the mercy of God for our sins and the healing He has provided is hindered. Jesus said it this way in Mark 11, \u201cIf you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive you.\u201d Notice He says, \u201cyour Father in Heaven\u201d he is talking to the believer in this verse. Jesus himself showed this to me many years ago when I first became a Christian. I am so glad he did because I want to live out my life showing mercy so that I will receive His mercy. Even though it has been difficult to forgive others at times, He has always helped me to forgive and I have found that life is more peaceful. If you need help forgiving someone, ask Him and keep your heart open and He will help you as well. As I have said many times in class and in my writings, \u201cA Peaceful heart leads to a healthy body.\u201d Proverbs 14:30, James 5:13-17, Mark 11:26, 1 Peter 2:24.\nPersonally I am thankful to God who loves us so much that he \u201ccorrects those he loves\u201d even though it feels uncomfortable. He also says, \u201cNo discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.\u201d Why? Because he\u2019s a cruel God? No! Because he knows that if we listen to him we can live a life full of the \u201cgood\u201d things that he has planned for us: Good and not evil. The evil comes when we refuse to follow His instructions. When we decide our way is better, we will continue to cleave to anger, wrath, malice, lying, hate, unforgiveness, judgement. Good comes when we choose to show Love and Mercy above all else, it is then that we will live in His Peace which leads to a healthy body. Love, God\u2019s Love in us is ALWAYS the answer to everything including our health. Colossians 3:1-17, Proverbs 14:30 NLT.",
    "question": "What does the scripture suggest for maintaining a peaceful heart and a healthy body?",
    "answer": "The scripture suggests that a peaceful heart leads to a healthy body. To achieve this, one must set their sights and focus on the things of heaven, taking their focus off earthly things. This involves letting go of anger, wrath, malice, and malicious behavior such as unforgiveness and judgement towards others. It also involves putting off our old sinful nature and putting on our new nature. This is a choice that individuals must make themselves. Furthermore, forgiveness and healing are connected, and if we judge others as unworthy of forgiveness, we hinder the healing that Jesus has provided.",

Experts say these secrets could damage the Hollywood studio for years to come.\nAlthough an unknown hacking group calling themselves the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d has taken partial credit for the major cyber-leak, the FBI is yet to determine the culprit,\nRather than focusing on traditional targets of cyber-intrusions, such as credit cards, those behind the attack chose to use sensitive information as a weapon of vengeance for Sony\u2019s supposed misdeeds.\nThe consequences for Sony have been swift and devastating since the public attack, exposing the media company to potential lawsuits and Hollywood backlash.\nPerhaps the most damaging will harm Sony\u2019s reputation, and the harsh reality that even the biggest corporate lines and computer systems are vulnerable to attack.\n\u201cThere is a ring of fire around the trade secrets of Hollywood, and the value of executives is in their ability to keep confidences and secrets and to maintain a level of distance,\u201d said Jeremy Goldman, an entertainment and intellectual property attorney for Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz.\nA humiliating email chain between Sony co-chairwoman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin was among those leaked, with Mr. Rudin fighting over copyright issues for the forthcoming Steve Jobs biopic, \u201cJobs\u201d (which was eventually lost to Universal), and pressuring Ms. Pascal to shelve the Sony remake of \u201cCleopatra\u201d starring Angelina Jolie. Rudin called Jolie, who requested director David Fincher to direct the \u201cCleopatra\u201d remake, a \u201cminimally talented spoiled brat\u201d while Pascal unsuccessfully tried to calm him down.\nEven more incriminating leaks include an exchange of emails between Sony executives which criticize President Barack Obama, insinuating racist comments as Rudin and Pascal start guessing what movies and actors the President might like, each tied to African Americans.\n\u201cShould I ask him if he liked DJANGO [Unchained]?\u201d Pascal asks in an email reported from BuzzFeed, to which Rudin responds, \u201c12 YEARS [A SLAVE].\u201d\nMore emails were released which reveal unflattering comments about big names in Hollywood such as Tom Cruise, David Fincher, Aaron Sorkin, Kevin Hart, and Adam Sandler.\nPascal\u2019s harsh words in the emails reveals a dark side of one of corporate America\u2019s most powerful leading female executives, who became co-chair of Sony Pictures in 2003 and helped develop box-office hits like \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Ma\u201dn and several \u201cJames Bond\u201d films. apologize for any injury they might have caused.\u201d\nBecause of the leaks, Sony executives are no longer corresponding via email but through text messages in a temporary effort to avoid further information exposure. Experts suggest that the studio may now have to pay its top-tier talent, particularly A-list celebrities like Jolie, three times as much as part of the damage control.\nPossible link to North Korea?\nFBI officials and investigators are also determining whether the cyber-attack is linked to North Korea, a reclusive nation with an increasingly potent hacking capability. Sources say the hack may have occurred in retaliation for Sony\u2019s upcoming Christmas release, The Interview, a comedy built around a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, who is revered in the nation. North Koreans have repeatedly denounced the film, warning of \u201cstern\u201d and \u201cmerciless\u201d retaliation, but the government has declined to comment.\nThe hacking into one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest studios has alarmed US officials and cyber security experts, who say this is the first major attack on a US company to use malicious software designed to \u201cincapacitate\u201d computer networks.\n\u201cThis is a step beyond what they\u2019ve done in the past, but it\u2019s a logical trajectory for them,\u201d said James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nA State Department official declined to comment on the allegations, but said, \u201cWe are aware of reports about North Korean concerns about this movie. While it may be difficult for them to understand the concept, in the United States entertainers are free to make movies of their choosing.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no attribution to North Korea at this point,\u201d said Joe Demarest, assistant director with the FBI\u2019s cyber division.\nSony has also declined to comment on the growing suspicions or internal damage to the company.\nThough there is no definite knowledge that North Korea is responsible for the hack, the country is remembered for its previous retaliation cyber-attacks against South Korean companies.\nThe FBI plans to meet with Sony executives to better train them in cyber security awareness, and is continuing its investigation of the alleged attackers.\n(With reports from Reuters, Washington Post, FOX News, CNBC, and The Hollywood Reporter)\n()\n(LA Weekend December 13-16, 2014 Sec.

The new requirements provided that counties could no longer accept foreign passports without a valid visa or Mexican consular IDs as valid forms of identification. The lawsuit alleged these changes violated the constitutional rights of the children.\nUnder the agreement, Mexican consular IDs will still no longer be accepted as valid forms of identification. However, Texas will reportedly expand the acceptable forms of identification to include Mexican voter ID cards that can now be obtained through the mail. The state will also expand acceptable secondary forms of identification to include paycheck stubs and utility bills. Parents from Central American countries will also now be able to obtain documents from their respective consulates as secondary forms of identification.\n\u201cThis agreement will allow the state to continue to provide necessary birth certificates to authorized people and do so in a way that maintains the security of state birth records,\u201d health department spokesman Chris Van Deusen told the news outlet. \u201cThe purpose of the identification requirement is to ensure that individuals requesting birth certificates are who they say they are.\n[image via screengrab]",

You can also see our recipe garlic milk: effective remedy to soothe sciatica, it will learn to prepare this remedy that is very effective in treating this problem.\nDo not stop reading: Milk Garlic: effective remedy to soothe sciatica\nGinger\nAnti-inflammatory, antioxidant and its power to alleviate the pain Ginger not only strengthen the immune system but also provide immense relief in pain. Drink ginger tea, that helps regulate sciatica relief. Cut a large piece of fresh ginger and grate it, add it to the boiling water and simmer for 3-5 minutes, strain the tea and drink 3 times a day.\nTurmeric\nFull antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. Turmeric is an ed herbs with more benefits available. It is used for its excellent effects on treatments for various health problems, including digestive, headaches and high cholesterol. This spice can also accelerate the metabolism and stimulates the immune system.\nBut what makes it ideal for this, is that its anti-inflammatory properties will help prevent sciatica pain.\nYou can start enjoying its benefits drinking tea or consuming it in different recipes. Another option is to mix a portion of turmeric with a small amount of water or olive oil and create a paste to be applied topically.\nfenugreek\nFenugreek has been widely used to relieve different types of pain and to maintain healthy nerves and bones. This species has a great antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and is also rich in vitamins and minerals.\nGrind the seeds of fenugreek powder and store in a jar, take a teaspoon of the powder with a hot cup of almond milk, or cow but is organic (if you are not intolerant to milk or are not under elimination diet ) and drink every morning.\nLemon juice\nUsing lemon juice is very beneficial to overcome problems of sciatica. Usually sciatic pains are due to acid buildup around the sciatic nerve. Lemon concentrate that quickly made alkaline buildup for quick relief from sciatic nerve pain. So next time you have sciatic pain, try a teaspoon of lemon juice.\nJuice celery and potatoes\nThe combination of celery juice and potato juice is also a popular natural remedy to treat sciatica. Mix these two juices in the same qualities and take 3 times a day. For maximum benefits, you can also add carrot juice and beet juice, both enhance the flavor and strength of the mixture.\nNutmeg\nAn oil prepared with nutmeg is one of the natural analgesic for more effective sciatica. Put a frying nutmeg coarse powder in sesame oil until all particles become brown. You can apply this oil as a pain reliever in the affected parts.\nChamomile\nChamomile is an effective herbal remedy for sciatica. Relaxes muscles, reduces stress on the sciatic nerve due to its anti-inflammatory properties.\nChamomile tea is a popular way of consuming chamomile for the treatment of sciatica. Add a teaspoon of dried camomile a cup of boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes and then casting the infusion. Drink 3 times a day.\nMoreover, it diluted chamomile essential oil in vegetable oil carrier such as almond, and rubbed into the affected parts. Do it regularly to relieve symptoms.\nspinal manipulation\nChiropractic care is one of the most effective in treating back pain and neck ways. Many different techniques include short, quick thrusts in chiropractic spinal manipulation to relieve nerve irritation that causes inflammation and other symptoms.\nA study conducted in 2010 and published in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, showed that 60 percent of participants who suffer from this condition, experienced the same relief due to spinal manipulation as if he had performed surgery.\nMassage\nMassage therapy can effectively treat sciatica pain and supports healing the body, especially if the cause is a muscle spasm. It will release tension, improve range of motion and stimulate blood circulation.\nYou can use oil of St. John's wort that has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and calms inflammation and pain of sciatica. Massaging the painful areas 2-3 times a day.\nAs pain begins in the lower back and extends along the thighs and buttocks, often associated with trigger points in the minimum and medium gluteus muscles, thus massage the trigger point at least once a day will provide a great relief.\nFurthermore, you can mix a cup sesame oil and 3 tablespoons nutmeg, heating the mixture, allow to cool and used for massaging. Repeat 2-3 times a week.\nL\u00facida research and writing of Life",

It\u2019s not a good combination, and I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t occur to me to wait until I finished my dinner to click on the video. It was kinda like the time when I discovered the \u201cFaces Of Death\u201d videos, and then sat down to watch them while eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. Duhhh!!!!\nBut its all smoky out, and we have to stay inside, because going outside and breathing all that ash would be even \u2026stupider. The sunrise and sunset here in L.A. are very beautiful though, and there is a gorgeous pink cast over everything. You can really see it in the light coming through the windows and bathing the floor. There\u2019s a warehouse across the street from my work and the outside of it is corrugated metal, and it reflected weak pink sunshine all day. The moonrise is an incredible orange glow. The ashes whirl around in the air and settle onto the cars, and affect people\u2019s lungs but isn\u2019t thick enough at all to affect visibility. I was listening to KNX 1070 a.m. all day, which seemed to give the most up to date coverage, but it\u2019s exhausting just to listen to, and makes me feel helpless. I have three friends that have been evacuated, but I think their houses are all safe. They\u2019re just taking precautionary measures. Plus, how breathable would their air be, if it\u2019s so bad all the way up here?

It was my friend Jenn\u2019s birthday, and that\u2019s her place of choice. We went there for her birthday 2 years ago, too. They have this great southern brunch where you can get so stuffed that you can\u2019t even walk, and then while you\u2019re recovering you can watch their gospel show. Last time we went, there was this little dude in all white singing, and he was getting so excited, and I got this image of him boogie-ing out into the audience and then boogie-ing on underneath the table, and then I pictured them having to stop the show and ask us to check under our tables for the gospel guy, saying, \u201cHe just gets over excited sometimes. He gets so filled up with the gospel, we can\u2019t stop him. Can you check your bags too?

It rocked my sense of reality, and led to a fitful night sleep full of dreams in which everyone\u2019s age was all scrambled up. And you know what? In my lifetime, this is at least the tenth time this has happened to me. You\u2019d think I would stop rolling with the five year olds, but they\u2019re just so cute and funny (but strong).\nI was at my friend\u2019s house for her one year-old\u2019s birthday party/ baptism celebration. She has a huge, wonderful traditional Mexican family, and the party went well into the night. All for a one-year old. There was a DJ, a Pinata, a bouncy castle, tons of food, three tables were fully loaded with presents, and her cul-de-sac was full of cars, double and triple parked all the way down the street. I was the only white person there, but that happens to me all the time. I don\u2019t usually get roughed up for it. The one who punched me was one of eight million cousins of the baby. I think he was mad because I was trying to talk to him about punching people. He looked me very seriously in the face and then said, \u201cyou\u2019re not my dad! My dad\u2019s a firefighter!\u201d He forgot the bond we\u2019d forged when his angry brother was chasing him around the bouncy castle, and I finally reached out and he leapt into my arms and I held him high in the air so that only his legs could, and did, get punched. While he was perched victoriously on my shoulder, he cheered and gave his brother the finger, and then spit on him. His brother started to spit on both of us, and then my little five year old friend lost his shoulder privileges.\nBy early evening, he\u2019d punched five adults and made both of his older brothers cry. I finally made a citizens arrest in the form of telling his mommy, and he got pulled out of the action for a long while. He\u2019s a very entertaining kid, and never stops smiling or yelling funny things. I\u2019m very curious to see how his life turns out.

    "context": "Why just a little pornography can be deadly\nWritten by Kendra White\n\u201cA little pornography can actually be a good thing,\u201d I read in horror. A Facebook friend had just posed the question, \u201cIs pornography good or bad?\u201d and the comments were pouring in. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you view in moderation,\u201d came the next reply.\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading. We are talking about pornography, right? The stuff that rips apart marriages, ruins lives, and causes many in the church to give up their pursuit of a holy and righteous God? Pornography- the stuff that is scientifically proven to be bad for your brain and statistically horrible for relationships? Good? You are seriously going to make an argument that it is good?\nIsaiah 5:20 says:\n\u201cWhat sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil, that dark is light and light is dark, that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.\u201d\nGood is being called evil and evil good. We live in a world that has exchanged the truth of God for a lie. The truth is this: even a little pornography is poison to your soul. Pornography is sin, and sin separates us from God (Matthew 5:27-28, James 1:14-15). You wouldn\u2019t tolerate even a little poison in your food, no matter how much was put in! So why do Christians allow themselves to consume something as toxic as pornography?\nGalatians 5 says sin is like a little yeast that works through the whole batch of dough. Pornography may start out feeling like just a little problem, but eventually it will work its way into destroying every area of your life if it is not confronted and dealt with.\nAs a culture, we have tolerated the sin of pornography and now its status has moved from \u201chorrible\u201d to \u201cnot that bad\u201d to \u201cgood in moderation.\u201d This is what happens when we make the mistake of comparing our holiness to that of those around us rather than to that of Christ. We think, \u201cI\u2019m doing better than the next guy,\u201d and all of a sudden that one slip up becomes an addictive temptation that leads to spiritual death.\nScripture gives us a clear warning of the danger of giving into such temptation.\nJames 1:14-15 says:\n\u201cBut each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death\u201d (emphasis added).\nWell-Placed Shame\nHere\u2019s what I find fascinating though. The person who posed this question openly admitted that they felt shame for viewing pornography. \u201cIf it\u2019s not wrong, then why do I feel bad about it?\u201d they wondered.\nThe conversation then took an interesting turn as my peers began to discuss the potential source of this shame. A few possible reasons were discussed. \u201cMaybe you need to stop hanging around with people who make you feel that way,\u201d suggested one person who boasted he felt no shame in his own pornography viewing.\nBut no one said, \u201cYou are feeling shame because you have sinned against God and need to repent.\u201d\nAccording to pastor John Piper, there is such a thing as well-placed shame. He said,  believe when it comes to pornography, the tightening in your stomach, the fear of being exposed, the uncomfortable feeling I hope you still feel\u2026is well-placed shame. It is the result of the convicting work of the Holy Spirit at work in your life. And if you ignore that feeling you will eventually stop feeling anything at all.\nWe live in a world that rejects shame and encourages us to be our \u201ctrue selves\u201d no matter the spiritual consequence. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to feel that way. Don\u2019t let others look down on you for your passions and desires,\u201d the world says. But God\u2019s word says that those who belong to Christ Jesus have \u201ccrucified the flesh with its passions and desires.\u201d When the world tells you sin is okay, it only makes you feel comfortable on your path to destruction. Well-placed shame, however, can lead a person toward repentance.\nThough feeling well-placed shame can be a good thing, it is not the same as repenting. To repent is to stop what you are doing and turn away from it. It is not feeling remorse for \u201cgetting caught\u201d or feeling bad for how your actions have affected others. It is about you crying out to a Holy God and honestly admitting your faults. It\u2019s about admitting that you are helpless without Christ and asking Him to give you the power to overcome sin.\nWhen we truly repent, God takes away our sin and our guilt so that we no longer have to wallow in it. Rather, as Scripture says in Hebrew 4:16, we can \u201capproach God\u2019s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.\u201d\nWe no longer need to feel condemned because as it says in Romans 8:1:\n\u201cThere is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nTo read more about Piper\u2019s thoughts on well-placed shame, check out these great articles:\nThis article was originally posted at AFA.net.\n",

    "context": "Any computer user with normal level skill set knows that any data removed from computer system can be recovered later with little bit of efforts. This is a good thing in the scenario when you have accidentally deleted your critical data. But in most cases, you don't want your private data to be recovered easily. Whenever we remove anything, the operating system deletes just the index of the particular data. It means that data is still there somewhere on the disk, this method is insecure, as any smart computer hacker can use any good data recovery tool to easily recover your deleted data. Linux users utilizes the well know \u201crm\u201d command to remove data from their operating system, but \u201crm\u201d command works in the conventional fashion. Data removed using this command can be recovered by special file recovery tools.\nLet\u2019s see how we can safely and completely remove files/folders from our Linux system. The methods mentioned below remove data completely so it becomes very hard for recovery tools to find traces of the actual data and recover it.\nSecure-\nSecure-Delete is a set of tools for Linux operating system and they provide advanced techniques for permanent removal of files. Once Secure-Delete has been installed on any Linux system, it provides following four commands:\n- srm\n- smem\n- sfill\n- sswap\nRun following command in the terminal to install it in ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install secure-delete\nRun following command to install it in RHEL, Fedora or Centos:\nsudo yum install secure-delete\n\u201csrm\u201d command works similarly to \u201crm\u201d command, but instead of just deleting the file, it first overwrites it multiple times with some random data and then removes the file permanently. The syntax for this command is pretty simply, just specify the file or directory to remove and it will take care of the task.\nsudo srm /home/aun/Documents/xueo/1.png\n\"sfill\" checks the specified partition/directories for space marked as free or available, and then uses its algorithm to fill it up with some random data. In this way it ensures that there are no more recoverable files/folders on the partition.\nsudo sfill /home\n\"sswap\" command is used to securely wipe your swap partitions. Swap partition is used to store data for running programs. First of all find out your swap partition by running the following command:\ncat /proc/swaps\nExample output of above command is show below:\nFilename Type Size Used Priority\n/dev/sda5 partition 2084860 71216 -1\nFrom here, you can see that swap is set to which partition, and then securely clean it by running the following command. Replace the \"/dev/sda5\" part with your partition name.\nsudo sswap /dev/sda5\n\u201csmem\u201d is used to clean the contents of memory, its true that RAM contents are cleaned when system is rebooted or powered off, but some residual traces of data still remain in the memory. This command provides secure memory cleaning, simly run smem command on the terminal.\nsmem\nShred\n\"shred\" command destroys files/folder\u2019s contents in a way that it is impossible to recover. It keeps overwriting the files with randomly generated data patterns so in this way it becomes very hard to recover any data from them even if hackers or thief uses high level of data recovery tools/equipments. Shred is installed by default on all Linux distributions, if you want, you can find its installation path by running following command:\nshred: /usr/bin/shred /usr/share/man/man1/shred.1.gz\nRun following command to remove file using shred utility.\nshred /home/aun/Documents/xueo/1.png\nRun following command to securely remove any partition using shred ; Replace partition name with your desired partition.\nshred /dev/sda5\nShred by default overwrites file with random contents 25 times. If you want it to overwrite file more than this, simply specify the desired number with \"shred -n\" option.\nshred -n 100 filename\nIf you want to truncate and remove file after overwriting, use \"shred -u\" option\nshred -u filename\ndd\nThis command is originally used for Disk Cloning. It is used to copy contents of one partition or disk to another. But it is also used for securely wiping out the contents of a hard disk or partitions. Run following command to overwrite your current data with random data.You don't need to install dd command, all Linux distributions include this command already.\nsudo dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda\nYou can also overwrite the contents of hard disk or partitions by simply replacing everything with \u201czero\u201d.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\nWipe\nWipe was originally developed to securely erase files from magnetic media. This command line utility writes special patterns to the files repeatedly. It uses fsync() call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access. It uses Gutmann algorithm for repeated writes. You can remove contents of single file, folder or entire hard disk with this command, but whole hard disk format using wipe command will take good amount of time. The installation and use of this utility is pretty easy.\nInstall wipe on ubuntu by running the following command on the terminal.\nsudo aptitude install wipe\nInstall Wipe in Redhat Linux, Centos or Fedora by running the following command:\nsudo yum install wipe\nOnce the installation is complete, run following command on the terminal to get complete list of its available options:\nman wipe\nRemove any file or directory as:\nwipe filename\nSecurely remove your tmp partition by running following command:\nwipe -r /tmp\nUse following command to remove contents of complete partition (replace partition name with your desired partition).\nwipe /dev/sda1\nConclusion\nWe hope you find this article useful, the privacy of your data is critical, its important to have such secure file removal utilities installed on your system so you may be able to remove your private data without fear of being recovered easily. All of the above mentioned tools are pretty lightweight, they take minimum system resources to run, and does not affect performance of your system in anyway. Enjoy!\nHave anything to say?",

    "context": "Stop, Think, Fix Errors\u2026 (Repeat!)\n\u201cDon\u2019t change your code unless you know how it will fix your problem\u201d. If I had to pick a quote to put a \u2018squiggly line and my name\u2019 next to, then this would be it.\nI\u2019ve seen developers stare blankly at an exception message, comment out a line of code or two and then try and run their code again hoping for the best.\nThis, of course, rarely fixes anything. Quite often the line of the error message has little to do with the actual problem. Instead, this introduces new errors into your code and causes the problem to take longer to resolve.\nEven if you guess and make an exception message go away you still don\u2019t know what caused the error to begin with. Instead, you have a new error that is quietly causing problems and is now much harder to find. They might be ugly, but exception messages are the easiest errors to fix\u2026 well, after compiler errors that is\u2026\nSo, how can you \u201cknow\u201d your change will fix the problem? Here are some of the recommendations I make to other developers.\nStop and Think\u2026 Carefully\nThe bug isn\u2019t going anywhere and each time you guess incorrectly you add a new error to your code.\nIt seems like such a silly thing to even mention, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of developers take a cursory glance at an exception message and then just start changing stuff. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you\u2019re in a \u201cbreak-fix\u201d situation \u2013 you should always carefully consider the problem before changing your code.\nRead the error, start following up the stack and think about what could cause this result. Think about the conditions that would cause the error or how you could force the error to happen again.\nIf you don\u2019t know why your change will fix the code then you aren\u2019t fixing anything.\nUnderstand the Debugger\nYou don\u2019t need to know what a memory dump is for or how read binary manually to use debugger. Just simply understanding how to set break points and stepping into, over and out of code will probably cover 99% of the problems you encounter.\nIt might seem daunting at first but don\u2019t ignore the debugger because logging or message boxes are easier to write. Once you get a hang of it, the debugger will most likely become the greatest tool in your future bug squashing adventures.\nIsolate and Resolve the Specific Problem\nIt can be difficult at times to figure out why a section of code doesn\u2019t work when it sits in the middle of a larger application. Sometimes its better to create an empty project and work with a smaller section of the program by itself.\nFor example, if you don\u2019t understand how a part of your framework is supposed to behave, pull it into a separate program, for example a console application, and work with it until you are comfortable with the results. Then when you integrate your changes back into the main project you can be confident that any remaining errors aren\u2019t part of the newly introduced code.\nLook At Open Source Code\nIf you\u2019ve written some code that is consistently causing problems then consider looking for a framework or open source project instead.\nThis isn\u2019t a matter of being a good or bad developer. It certainly has nothing to do with being unable to figure out the problem for yourself. Quite simply, code that consistently has errors is probably a difficult problem.\nPublic frameworks and open source projects are typically owned by other developers that understand the problem better than others. They have taken the time to abstract away the specifics of a problem and build a clean API for other developers to use.\nThese developers are also typically eager to improve their code and will listen to feedback. Even if you don\u2019t use their project there\u2019s a good chance that you will learn something by simply reading their code.\nTo sum it up, don\u2019t just change code and hope for the best. Stop, think, ask yourself how does this fix the problem?.\nHow do you approach fixing problems in your code?\nGood post. In school I helped people try and work through writing their class projects. Honestly most of their \u2018problems\u2019 came from the fact that they really just didn\u2019t know how to debug and work out their bugs. No one writes bug-less code the first time, so this is a critical skill. A skill that I think is poorly represented in formal education, and it shows in more than a couple of the people I\u2019ve worked with beyond college.\nMike\nJuly 6, 2010 at 11:26 am\nThanks Mike,\nI agree that the debugger ought to be one of the first things that instructors should be teaching their students, but unfortunately, in my experience, the debugger is never even mentioned. I can\u2019t think as to why unless the instructor themselves either thinks it causes students to think through problems more carefully or that they themselves haven\u2019t used it much either.\nhugoware\nJuly 8, 2010 at 5:45 pm",

It was very upsetting to the cameramen who. But it was also my goodbye, and we were all very attached. So it was a difficult scene, and I wanted to get it over with quickly. It took a little bit longer, because it was Sharon return. I was feeling that while experiencing being left out, and also experiencing a great feeling of fulfillment, because she was completed in what I thought was a really wonderful way.\nI had a lot of prep for this. Quite often. First of all, we were moved from our famous Sharon. James included me in his creative. He did fill me in right at the very beginning?\nOnly when we were getting close to it. I did]. And might I say one more thing? There was?\u201d I do think that this happens now in the industry \u2014 and it isn\u2019t just TNT \u2014 as we transform into different platforms and to different ways of creating audiences, it is no longer the only ingredient for how you\u2019re evaluating what it is you want to do. Kevin Reilly [TBS/TNT president and chief creative officer for Turner Entertainment] was in the process of creating his particular vision, and for whatever reason, our actual live numbers weren\u2019t a strong enough factor in his envisioning. That\u2019s the only way I can see it. I\u2019m not a studio executive. I don\u2019t know.\nStepping back a little bit, when you heard that \u201cMajor Crimes\u201d was being spun off from \u201cThe Closer,\u201d what were your expectations and hopes?\nWell, it was a very unclear what was going to happen, partly because it was a spinning off, but also, it wasn\u2019t a spinning off of a character into a new show. It was a spinning off of an entire show, minus one person. It was a little tricky at the beginning. Sharon. So he had to figure out how to turn Sharon. I think they are funny. I think that they I was shooting them, I thought to myself, \u201cWell, Sharon doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d [However as viewers saw, Sharon did realize within the episode that she had to go on a health leave.] When you are leaving one reality, which she was, to go into another one \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me now? I can\u2019t go to work. I\u2019ve got to deal with this other thing,\u201d you do have a sensation of, \u201cI better make sure I look people in the eye. I better make sure I say, \u2018Do you know I love you?\u2019 to people.\u201d That was the kind of feeling that Sharon was L.A.P.D. I learned a great deal of respect. James and his staff found ways to integrate some of the exposition into character and make it more natural. I have a whole new view of the [factors that lead to the] success of procedural television shows that I did not understand before.\nI also rediscovered things that are still very vibrant and alive in me that I learned as a young Catholic girl. There was a bottom line of faith that Sharon demanded I explore in myself, and I was very, very, very pleased to get back in there.\nIt was such an evocative scene when she was in the church and asked for Last Rites.\nI thought that too. I thought it was a great. I learned something about the type of person.\nSo how are you feeling about the final season of \u201cMajor Crimes\u201d and the ending of Sharon Raydor\u2019s story?\nI feel that it was done beautifully and respectfully,. I think that what James felt very strongly when he envisioned how this would go is \u2014 he wanted fans to be able to feel and grieve the end of this beautiful franchise together, collectively. I think he succeeded, and I feel very proud of it.\nSharon did go out on the job \u2014 dying at work. Does it feel like she went out in the line of duty to you?\nOh, absolutely.

    "context": "Mr. Chalmers smoked huge, thick chuck roasts he rubbed with his special combination of salt, salt, salt, cayenne, dried oregano, and sliced garlic. I think he cooked them with hickory for about three and a half hours, and they were nice and tender, juicy, spicy, meaty. Chuck really is an excellent cut of meat for smoking, and I'm surprised more people don't use it instead of the more expensive brisket. The only trick is slicing it across the grain, which tends to go every which way. We've even smoked thinner chuck \"steaks\" with great results.\nIn the oven, in a (cowboy?) bain marie, we baked a simple corn pudding with roasted poblano peppers: corn, peppers, milk, heavy cream, melted butter, fresh eggs from the lady down the road, et cetera.\nThe night before, I soaked two pounds of Great Northern beans in water. Early the next morning, I simmered the beans in fresh water for about an hour, drained them, and added new water, some molasses, dry mustard, a little ketchup, a lot of bacon, and one and a half chopped onions. I dug a hole and started a big fire in it, and let it burn down to embers. It was cold outside, and had just begun to get light. With the Mister's help I set the Dutch oven full of beans, along with a few potatoes brushed with butter, seasoned with fresh herbs, and wrapped in foil, down in the coals and we shoveled some of the coals on top, then covered the whole thing with dirt until we couldn't see any smoke rising from the ground. I think the fire probably died when we covered it with dirt, because when we dug the pot up five hours later it was barely warm. So I put the pot on the stovetop and finished up the beans the regular way. These were New England\u2013style beans, not Southern or Texas beans, but they were pretty rustic anyway. We put the potatoes and sweet potatoes in the coals in the smoker while the meat was cooking.\nMore successful was the cobbler, which we made in an eight-quart Dutch oven (\"Made in China for Texsport, Houston\") with a flat, rimmed lid and three legs. Apples, pears, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and tapioca. I precooked the fruit a bit because I wasn't sure how it would work on an open fire, but as it turns out I didn't need to do that: the hardwood fire Mr. Chalmers and our friend built in the old goat-cooking pit was extremely hot, and the fruit juices were boiling in no time. As soon as it was all bubbly, Mr. Chalmers mixed up a biscuit-y topping (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, half butter and half nonhydrogenated shortening, then milk) and dolloped it on, trying not to singe his arm. We put the lid on and piled coals on top. We let it cook like that for about twenty minutes, then I said it was time, and we pushed the coals off the pot and lifted the lid and it was perfect. A little blackened on the side closest to the center of the fire, but otherwise just right. It may well be the best cobbler I've ever had a hand in making. The apples and pears were all dark and caramelized, and somehow the topping was both fluffy and crisp, and tasted as if it had been baked, then fried, then drizzled with caramel. And there was just a touch of smoke flavor, or maybe that was burnt flavor\u2014in any case, I liked it. A lot.\nAdd Miller Lite and Bailey's Irish Cream (brought by our friends from town) and it was a fine way to celebrate our Irish cowboy heritage.",

It was a fantastic day of peaceful protests as we made our voices heard all along the route from Wembley to the O2 Arena in Greenwich. There's hardly a shot of the London Olympic Torch Relay that doesn't have a Tibetan flag in the background!\nAs the torch continues on to Paris and San Francisco, the protests have followed, turning China's propaganda of a \"Journey of Harmony\" into a PR nightmare. Meanwhile questions are being asked both in London and Paris about the role of the Chinese security guards surrounding the torch, described by Lord Coe as \"thugs\". Australian authorities have already refused to allow them to participate in the Canberra leg of the torch relay.\nEven IOC President Jacques Rogge has finally been forced to state \"The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and called for a rapid, peaceful resolution of Tibet\".\nUnfortunately people in China will not being seeing the full scale of the protests in London and Paris which Chinese officials have condemned as \"vile behaviour\" from \"a tiny number of Tibet independence elements\". Official estimates of that \"tiny number\" are over 3000 people!\nYou can see a round-up of events from the day in the photos and videos below including the wonderful Tibetan Torch rally at Argyle Square.

    "context": "A person\u2019s greatness is not measured by their words, but rather by their deeds. A person\u2019s actions are a good representation of their heart and their character. King Ahasuerus has shown his character throughout the book of Esther. He showed off his kingdom and held a 6 month long party for all of his officials, then he threw a party for the whole kingdom. During this party, he banished his wife from the kingdom because she would not do as he commanded. He chose Esther out of many women from a royal beauty contest as his queen. In Esther 2:18, during the wedding ceremony and celebration he rescinded the \u201ctaxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.\u201d (Esther 2:18). He allowed Haman to pass an edict that would eliminate an entire race of people, even though he was unaware of what race he was eliminating. Since King Ahasuerus could not rescind the original law, he allowed the Jews to defend themselves which resulted in the loss of at least 75,000 people. Now in Esther 10:1, the tax that he had rescinded in Esther 2:18 is being reinstituted. The meaning of this word \u201ctax\u201d in the original Hebrew means \u201cforced labor.\u201d\nThis encapsulated version of King Ahasuerus\u2019s life helps us see his character. He is impetuous and does not stop to consider the consequences of his decisions. The contrast of his life is that of Mordecai\u2019s. Mordecai raised his niece, was important in the palace of the king and when he overheard a conversation that would threaten the life of the King he reported it to the right people. He gave Esther sound advice throughout her life that showed his love for his people and his willingness to do what was needed to save the entire race of the Jews. He became second in command even though he was not a Persian, but rather from a race of captured people. As second in command, \u201che was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brothers, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people.\u201d (Esther 10:3).\nThe character of Haman also speaks for itself as he plotted the murder of an entire race of people because one man did not bow down to him. This anti-Semitist attitude evidently had permeated the entire Persian culture. According to Esther 9, there were 75,000 people who were killed because they hated the Jews and sought \u201cto destroy, to kill, and to annihilate them.\u201d (Esther 3:13). There is no record of any Jews being slain during this time of personal vendetta. \u201cNow the rest of the Jews who were in the King\u2019s provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75, 000 of those who hated them\u2026\u201d (Esther 9:16). If a person did not hate and decide to attack the Jews they were safe from destruction. An edict against the entire race of the Jews to kill them was not enough personal satisfaction for Haman since he also had gallows 75 feet tall constructed to hang Mordecai on, the apparent root of his hatred and bitterness.\nEsther\u2019s character also shines through the events recorded about her life. She is raised by her uncle so at some point in her life she had to deal with the loss of her parents. She becomes part of this royal beauty pageant and wins. Though she is not a Persian, she becomes queen. Just another fact about King Ahasuerus. He does not do a background check on the new Queen but takes her as his wife based on her looks. Esther does as her Uncle Mordecai suggests and she willingly lays down her life for her people, since she does not know the response she will receive from the King since she had not seen him for 33 days. By the end of the book, the King is coming to Esther and asking her what she wants to happen. (Esther 9:12)\nGod takes the character of people and uses it for His purposes and plans. The theme of Esther and the central verse of the book is Esther 4:14 \u201c\u2026And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\u201d\nQuestions:\n- As we have reviewed the lives of the main characters in the book of Esther, their character shines through their actions. Read Matthew 7:16-20 and record what Jesus says and how it applies to each of the characters in the book of Esther. What fruit is evident? What made the difference in each of their lives?\n- Take some time and evaluate your life. Think about the decisions you have made and how they have impacted your life. Think about the deliberate choices you have made and the impetuous choices you have made and record the impact it had on your life.\n- Read Matthew 25:14-30. Which servant are you at this point in your life? What changes do you need to make no matter which servant you are, no matter how great or small the changes are to be counted more faithful by the Lord?\n- Realizing that you cannot do this task on your own, who must you enlist to help you and what must you overcome in order to become more faithful?",
    "question": "Who became second in command in the story of Esther and what was his character like?",
    "answer": "Mordecai became second in command in the story of Esther. He was portrayed as a caring and wise individual who raised his niece, played an important role in the king's palace, and saved the entire race of Jews. He was known for his love for his people and his willingness to do what was necessary for their welfare. Despite being from a race of captured people, he was greatly respected among the Jews and popular with his brothers.",

    "context": "a classic and therefore enjoy without a second thought. However, a closer look into these rock hits reveals the hidden meaning behind why the lyrics were written and what hidden messages the artists are trying to communicate.\nHere are five influential pieces that take a little digging to fully understand the hidden messages in the songs:\n\u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d \u2013 Bonnie Tyler\nUpon first listen, \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d comes off as an emotionally charged love song. What most listeners don\u2019t know is that it was originally written as a vampire love song and was featured in Jim Steinman\u2019s Broadway musical, Dance of the Vampires.\nWhen you listen closely, lyrics like \u201cOnce upon a time there was light in my life, but now there\u2019s only love in the dark\u201d lend themselves to a more cryptic theme. Although the song never outright mentions vampires or coffins, the tones of the song make sense for use in the musical. Despite its roots, this rock music meaning is widely known as a love song (for mortals).\n\u201cLondon Calling\u201d \u2013 The Clash\nOften interpreted as a politically charged anthem about the British government, \u201cLondon Calling\u201d was actually inspired by Joe Strummer\u2019s fear of drowning. At the time of the song\u2019s creation, headlines warning Londoners about the flooding of the Thames river sparked fear \u2013 and inspiration \u2013 in the band.\nLyrics like \u201cThe ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in. Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin\u2019 thin. Engines stop running, but I have no fear \u2019cause London is drowning, and I, I live by the river\u201d portray the warning as the start of the end of the world. Mick Jones explains that while the song was inspired by Strummer\u2019s fear of drowning, it unfolded into a general warning of doom.\n\u201cHey Jude\u201d \u2013 The Beatles\nThis Beatles hit was written by Paul McCartney shortly after John Lennon\u2019s divorce from his wife, Cynthia. Lennon\u2019s son, Julian, who was five at the time, was having a rough time accepting his parent\u2019s divorce. McCartney was close to the family and developed a special relationship with Julian, who he empathized with. He began singing \u201cHey Jules\u2026\u201d to himself and wrote the original draft of \u201cHey Jude\u201d as a gesture of comfort for Julian.\nHe later expanded the lyrics and changed the name in the song to \u201cJude\u201d to fit his style. Lines like \u201cAnd anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don\u2019t carry the world upon your shoulders\u201d depict the comforting tone that McCartney was trying to communicate. It wasn\u2019t until 20 years later that Julian discovered the song was originally created for him.\n\u201cAmerican Pie\u201d \u2013 Don McLean\nWhile the upbeat pace and catchy lines of this song sound like a cheerful anthem of American youth, it was actually written as a goodbye to an era. In 1959, Buddy Holly, along with several other musical superstars, boarded a plane that tragically crashed, killing everyone aboard. This rocked the music world and inspired Don McLean to write \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d in 1972.\nLyrics like \u201cThe day the music died\u201d are in reference to that fatal plane crash, which symbolizes the loss of the romance and idyll that characterized the fifties and sixties. In short, the song illustrates the departure of the American dream in a way that is simultaneously light and comforting.\n\u201cHotel California\u201d \u2013 The Eagles\nThis mellow, catchy hit seems like a west-coast-vacation-inspired ballad, but upon closer inspection, the lyrics are actually calling out excess in America. The song depicts the high life in LA as interpreted by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, and Don Felder. Lyrics like \u201cThey stab it with their steely knives, but they just can\u2019t kill the beast\u201d and \u201cYou can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!\u201d expose the darker side of an extravagant LA lifestyle. In the 2013 History of the Eagles documentary, Don Henley explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a song about a journey from innocence to experience.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s a political statement decorated with a cheerful chorus or a personal message of comfort embedded in a chart-topping classic, hidden messages in songs add depth to the artist\u2019s work. Often times, song inspiration sparks from societal events, personal struggles and triumphs, cultural nostalgia, or opinions of the artist. Taking the time to pick apart the lyrics and identify the significance behind them can cultivate a deeper connection to the song and, as a result, the artist.",

The gifts never really seem quite straight forward; it all depends on how long you\u2019ve been dating, how serious you are and what type of relationship you have. Here\u2019s how I see it: if you are in a new relationship and don\u2019t want to go all out, think small \u2013 buy her chocolates, flowers or that cute teddy bear you eyed up at Hallmark. They sound cliche, but sometimes we girls are simple. If it\u2019s a new relationship, she\u2019ll just be happy that you got her anything!

We wi\nll have more of these blog posts in the future, so stay tuned!\nInside the package you\u2019ll find your FitPAWS\u00ae Peanut, and taped to it will be two small plugs. This is what holds the air in the Peanut.\nYou also get your safety, care and use instructions. Please read them thoroughly. And, also make sure to watch the How-To-Use DVD that comes with it.\nYou\u2019ll get a FitPAWS\u00ae Pump, as well. The pump includes two attachments.

Please screw the cone-shaped attachment onto the end of your FitPAWS\u00ae Pump.\nNow it\u2019s time to get measuring tape out and we\u2019ll start inflating the Peanut according to size. All of the FitPAWS Peanuts have the maximum inflation in centimeters and inches printed on the side of the ball. The Peanut will perform best at 95% inflation. You do not have to inflate the FitPAWS Peanut to max inflation, and using it under-inflated will actually be more challenging for your dog.\nWatch me measure the FitPAWS Peanut at the highest bulb. I\u2019m making sure not to over-inflate the Peanut, as this compromises its structural integrity and may weaken or damage the material. When you\u2019re ready to inflate the Peanut, go ahead and take your pump, place it inside the hole and begin pumping.\nWe recommend inflating your FitPAWS Peanut in two stages. On day one, inflate your FitPAWS Peanut to 80% percent of max inflation. On day two, you can start inflating your FitPAWS Peanut to size. You do not have to use a FitPAWS Peanut at full inflation. The material is really thick, and it gets more difficult to add air as you reach its max inflation. Please note, as a quality assurance test, all peanuts have been inflated to size at the factory, then deflated and packaged. As you put air in it, the material does expand\u2026so, keep pumping until your FitPAWS Peanut gets to the right size.\nThanks so much for purchasing the FitPAWS\u00ae Peanut, and thanks for watching!\nAgain, please follow the safety, care and use instructions that are included with your FitPAWS\u00ae Peanut.

Students with catalog terms prior to 201310 will continue to run degree audits using CAPP.\nDegree Works data is refreshed nightly from the Banner Student Information System. Any modifications made to student data in Banner (i.e. registration, change of major, change of grades, etc.) will be reflected in Degree Works within 24-48 hours.\nHow is the Degree Works Audit organized?\nThe audit appears in categorical sections:\n- Student biographical information: Information about the student that is independent of degree choice. You may use this information to determine obstacles to registration, eligibility for certain sections, and possibility of academic standing difficulties.\n- Other Information: Degree selection and program of study are entered to identify which degree requirements the student should follow.\n- Summary List of Degree Requirements: All of the requirements are listed in a single section at the beginning of the audit. The boxes next to each requirement are checked off as requirements are fulfilled.\n- General Education Requirements: These degree requirements are organized in the following groups: AREA I. Written Composition; AREA II. Literature, Humanities, and Fine Arts; AREA III. Natural Sciences and Mathematics; and AREA IV. History, Behavioral, & Social Sciences. The blue bar displays your catalog year which determines the general education requirements the student must follow.\n- Major, Minor and Concentrations: Each major, minor, and concentration will be displayed in a block indicating the program requirements, the courses that may be used to fulfill them, and/or the courses the student has already taken to complete the requirements. The blue bar which displays the major, minor, or concentration, also includes the student\u2019s catalog year (this determines the degree requirements to be followed in order to graduate), the GPA for the major, as well as the credits already applied.\n- Other Requirements: Additional degree requirements may be listed after the student\u2019s major, minor, and/or concentration. For undergraduate students, this will include the upper division in residence and writing requirements.\n- Additional Credits: Contains all the courses the student has taken that do not fulfill defined degree requirements.\n- Insufficient and Excluded Repeat Courses: Lists all courses taken with grades that are insufficient to fulfill degree requirements such as F, WD, IP, and RA grades (courses that have been repeated).\n- In Progress: Lists all courses the student is currently taking or has registered for in a future semester.\n- Not Counted: Lists any courses taken that cannot be applied towards the student\u2019s degree, such as remedial course work (i.e. DS 014, DS 082). This may also include transfer courses if the student exceeds the maximum number of community college transfer credits.\nHow does Degree Works determine which set of degree requirements to use?\nDegree Works uses a student\u2019s Catalog Year to determine the set of degree requirements to use when producing a degree audit.\nAre in-progress courses applied to the audit?\nCourses students are currently taking or have registered for in a future semester are included in the degree audit. These courses are applied into the requirement block(s) where they meet a specific requirement with a grade of IP for In-progress. You will also see them grouped in a separate section titled In-progress near the bottom of the audit. Please be aware that the total credit counts listed near the top of the audit include in-progress credits.\nIf a student withdraws from a class, will that be reflected in their Audit?\nYes. Courses from which a student has withdrawn will appear in the \"Insufficient\" block on their audit.\nHow does Degree Works decide where to place courses that a student has completed?\nDegree Works looks at the student\u2019s program holistically and places each course using a \u201cbest fit\u201d scenario. We've also programmed priorities so that courses will be used in some areas before they will be used in others. This process will not always be perfect, particularly when multiple possibilities exist, so if the student has taken a course that does not appear in the area in which you wanted to use it, you may create an exception to move the course to the desired area\nWhat is the GPA calculator?\n- Graduation Calculator: Determines what grades you need to reach your desired GPA upon graduating.\n- Term Calculator: Sets specific goals for the classes in your current term.\n- Advice Calculator: Determines how many credits of a specific grade average you need to reach your desired GPA.\nHow do I use the GPA calculator?\n- Choose a GPA Calculator type and click Load.\n- Fill in the requested information and click Calculate.\nWith Advising Notes, any notes you enter become a part of a student\u2019s record, and any faculty or administrative staff member who has access to Degree Works can view those notes. This allows any individual working with a student \u2013 including future advisors \u2013 to have a more complete understanding of the student\u2019s advising history. This also helps us work together to hold students accountable for following through on advice they were given. In addition, because Degree Works is a secure, web-based product, you can easily access your advising notes from any internet connection.\nWill students be able to see the notes I enter?\nYes. The student will see your note at the end of his or her worksheet. Any faculty or administrative staff member with access to Degree Works will be able to view all the notes on a student\u2019s record.\nI need to record more specific information on a student. Can I enter notes without the drop-down menu?\nNot at this time. These advising notes are designed to be general in nature, and to record the basic content of an advising session. To ensure consistency, entries are limited to standardized selections from the drop-down menu. For detailed or particularly sensitive information, we recommend that you continue to keep written notes and store them in a secure location.\nHow do you decide what notes to include in the drop-down menu?\nThe drop down list is mostly standard topics. While we realize that these topics will not cover every advising situation, we believe they include the most common topics.\nI often have advising discussions with students who are not my assigned advisees. Can I add notes to any student's record?\nYes, and we encourage you to do so.\nI do not think I am seeing the most current information in my internet browser window.\nHow can I refresh the display?\nUsually CTRL/F5 will refresh the display but you can also check out specific suggestions for various browsers at\nAdditional Tips & FAQs for Degree Works\nCheck out the Degree Works Tips & FAQs for additional information about using the application.",

I've finished my review of Oblivion, unless I want to mention the bombastic score too, but I think I've done enough. I suppose it depends on what these other two signatures are that have popped up overnight. I launch probes and scan, resolving gas and more gas to go with the rest of the gas accumulating in our system. I should probably generate some ISK for our operations.\nTo the tower, in to the Golem marauder, and out to the first anomaly of the evening. Rewatching Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol the other day, I couldn't help but wonder why it was revealed that Hendriks went to the meeting in the Burj Khalifa with a mask on. It was established that Wistrom, his right-hand man and choice for the disguise, hadn't met their contact, Moreau, otherwise the duped meeting with the M:I squad wouldn't have worked. Surely Hendriks knew that, so why disguise himself as Wistrom?\nI can understand Hendriks perhaps not wanting to wander around without a disguise, because of his high profile status. I can almost understand him not wanting to send Wistrom to the meeting unsupervised, because of the high stakes in what was involved, although you'd think he'd trust his right-hand man more. But if you are Hendriks wanting to make sure you got the right materials, weren't double-crossed, and weren't recognised, why disguise yourself as your known accomplice? Wistrom essentially attracted just as much attention as Hendriks.\nIt would have made more sense for Hendriks to turn up wearing a completely neutral disguise, because he wouldn't have been tracked and Moreau wouldn't have noticed. Or wear a neutral disguise and pretend to be Wistrom's right-hand man for the deal, to be there, be represented, and still go unnoticed. It seems that the reveal of the mask was there solely to have one used in a manner that didn't spoil the plot by being entirely overused, as in M:I 2, and tucked away at the end of an action sequence in the hopes of its not making any sense going unnoticed. Maybe I'm missing something.\nTwo anomalies are cleared of Sleepers, and their wrecks are looted and salvaged to bring back a fair 170 Miskies of plunder. That's not bad. The first anomaly even had my Golem not sitting in a blinding fog bank, letting me enjoy the view. It was almost a pleasant experience. Now to poke our neighbouring class 3 w-space system in my Proteus strategic cruiser, see what's happening in today's local constellation.\nJumping to C3a has my directional scanner showing me nothing, although opening the system map and seeing just how much space there is between the planets makes the negative result less surprising. One planet is in range, and the system is 125 AU across. There doesn't look to be much too see overall, which there isn't, but the eight anomalies and six signatures are spread over so much volume that it feels like less. I launch probes and perform a blanket scan to see if I can add any ships to the signatures, and I can't. There aren't even any structures, none at all, so the system is unoccupied.\nI scan. Gas, wormhole, wormhole, relics, and a wormhole. There's a lot of space between our K162 and the wormholes, and as there's no occupation to watch I am in warp to each connection as soon as it is resolved. A K162 from class 4 w-space could be interesting, the static exit to low-sec obviously leads to Domain, and a K162 from class 2 w-space would be much more attractive if it weren't at the end of its life. Never mind, I pop out to Domain to bookmark the K162 in low-sec, duly noting the three extra signatures should I need more to scan, then back to C3a and across to see what's waiting for me in C4a.\nMy goodness, it's the nexus of w-space: J100001. Naturally, there is a tower lacking ships visible on d-scan, and although a big cluster of green highlights fourteen anomalies there are only two signatures present. Maybe the other one is a K162. I warp away from the wormhole and tower, launch probes, and blanket the system. Nope, the other signature is weak, clearly not a K162. Curious, and because it's just one, I identify the signature as gas. There's nothing else to do in this system, and I head back to low-sec to see what the signatures are there. Back through a now-dying C247 to C3a, a clear indication that I'm hours late to whatever activity there might have been.\nThree extra signatures in low-sec, three wormholes resolved. I warp to the first, wondering how many will be a result of the explosion of empire-empire connections tonight, and drop out of warp next to, huh, another K162 from deadly class 6 w-space. These seem more frequent too. The second wormhole is an N944 to more low-sec, leading to Essence from the colours, and relatively useless. The last is a K162 from class 5 w-space. Not great options, but I work with what I've got.\nIn to C5a and d-scan is clear, a blanket scan revealing seventeen anomalies and ten signatures. Again there are no ships and no structures. I've done enough here. Back to low-sec, across to the other K162, and in to C6a. D-scan is clear, and I have to page my way through fifty-six anomalies to see the fourteen signatures, lack of ships, and sole structure somewhere in the system. That ain't no on-line tower. I'm not finding anything tonight, it seems. Not with this attitude, at least, the attitude of going home to get some sleep.\nSorry, comments for this entry are closed.",

    "context": "Digital transformation projects need leadership. So what is the difference between top-down and bottom-up leadership? As a concept, bottom-up leadership emerged from the egalitarian ideals that swept the Western world in the 20th century. These emphasise participation as a means of drawing on all the skills and knowledge an organisation\u2019s employees have to offer. But while bottom-up leadership is often framed as the path toward innovation, top-down approaches have always remained important in practice and may even be seeing an ideological resurgence.\nTop-down leaders set a clear direction \u2013 one that does not always value everyone\u2019s input equally \u2013 but crucially, they do listen when it helps with innovation. Steve Jobs, for instance, famously directed the consumer tech market through singular products and design choices that were Apple\u2019s own, rarely ever listening to focus groups or chasing existing trends. This led to Apple becoming one of the world\u2019s most successful companies and the most widely recognised brand in the world. When he launched the iPhone back in 2007, the manner in which he presented his thinking about how the iPhone came about was a very top-down approach. He recited, with laser sharp precision, details of why and how he wanted to create his first smartphones to be far more than just a phone married to some email capability. His crystal clear vision was to give the customer a communications device that integrated all three of Apple\u2019s successes (computers, software, iTouch/iPod) into a single product \u2013 in addition to the phone element. So, he/they set about pulling together all of Apple\u2019s innovations (the widescreen iPod with touch controls, software and a computer) into a revolutionary product that we know today as the iPhone.\nIf he had taken the bottom-up approach, they\u2019d have viewed it differently: a bit like Blackberry did, in a way. It seems that the company took its very successful phone and push-email services and chased fickle consumer market trends that ate away into its established success when it decided to tactically add elements to the product.\nThe same applies to digital transformation \u2013 you can not just add elements as you go along to feed the needs of your employees or the business whilst trying to answer market trends. The board-level roles are extremely important in establishing a visionary view of how you want your business to be in this Fast IT environment of immediate communications, transactions, deliveries, and payments etc. As I mentioned in my last post, it is fine to have one person leading the digital transformation, and many great digital deployments have a single figurehead, but I believe it is better to have a group of people, all of whom are invested in the project, driving the whole outcome. This group is ideally composed of people from different functional groups across the business, not just technologists. And that\u2019s because each member of the group needs to keep their eye on how their function can contribute to the overall objective. If you don\u2019t take a holistic approach, then all you will do is undertake discrete digital projects that will probably not end up reaping the full benefits of digital transformation. In fact, you are probably more likely to fail with a lot of these digital transformations because the style of an individual department within the organisation changes year-on-year, which has an effect on other parts of the organisation.\nThe circle is vicious if you take this \u2018treatment\u2019 approach to business processes that juxtapose other processes in your company. Therefore, you cannot look at it from a bottom-up perspective that stems from individual functions or inputs. It really should be based on an enterprise-wide view of your company\u2019s strategic outcomes, and this is where Fujitsu\u2019s co-creation approach comes in, as well as the digital consultant \u2013 which I will be talking about more in my next blog post. Having someone on your board that can answer your \u2018Steve Jobs-like\u2019 questions and provide a roadmap to success will empower you to become a visionary leader who understands market trends, and addresses employee needs whilst building digital momentum. So, in essence, the bottom-up approach will not work for your digital transformation projects, because business processes cannot be dealt with tactically in today\u2019s multi-faceted business technology environment. Not if you truly want to succeed.\nHave you missed some of my blog series on avoiding the 10 pitfalls of digital transformation? If so please read the full series here:\nThe 10 pitfalls of digital transformation #7: Be Realistic \u2013 Don\u2019t Call Out Digital Success Too Early!FACE2FUJITSUMarch 17, 2017",

    "context": "When people ask how I'm doing since James left, I typically reply with \"I'm fine, he'll be home before I know it\". I tell people this because if I really stop and think about it, I will end up in tears. To be completely honest, I am doing fine and I do know that the time will fly by but there are still moments that are unavoidable, that I miss him so much and just wish I could hold him in my arms. Last time James was gone for nine months total but at that time James and I weren't married and living together. I knew this time would be different, going from spending every day together to none at all. It amazes me that after 8 1/2 years, I still am able to love him more and more with every passing day. I am so thankful James has the opportunity to call most nights and send Facebook messages, emails, and even Skype on occasion. I don't know how couples dealt with only being able to send letters back and forth with no other avenue of communication.\nGod has blessed me with friends and family who have helped me succeed with keeping busy. I know I sound like a crazy cat lady when I say this but I also don't know what I would do without my cats, Smokie and Bandit. It's crazy how they know when I am upset, and they comfort me. Two nights ago I was crying and Bandit (our semi evil cat) licked the tears off my face and curled up with me all night long.\nThis is Bandit, the semi evil cat.\nI'm sitting here trying to think of the exciting things I have done since James left, the people and events that have kept me busy over the past two months. Of course I was able to spend a lot of time with family throughout the holiday season. There are five other things that come to mind.\n1. My sister-in-law Emily and her husband Nathan just purchased a house so I got to help them paint a few rooms and move them in. It's so exciting to see Emily, Nathan and Rosie in a house where they can expand their family one day.\n2. Tara taught me how to crochet. I have wanted to learn how to do this for a long time but for some reason when I tried to learn the first time, years ago, I really struggled with just using one crochet hook rather than two knitting needles. I was meaning for this hat to fit an adults head but you can see by the photo that it is meant for a child's head, so my little sister ended up with an extra Christmas gift. :-) Now I can check \"learn to crochet\" off my bucket list....I never said the crochet project had to turn out exactly as planned.\n3. I've always had a fascination with wanting to learn how to fix cars and wanting to learn the skill of carpentry. The reason I haven't attempted either of these things before is that I don't want to break a nail....not because I'm a girly girl, just because I have to keep my nails nice for work. This month, with my brother Jon, I learned how to replace a slave cylinder on an Eclipse. It's amazing how something so small can stain your nails so badly. It was worth it. I will have to save carpentry for another day.\n4. I spent New Years Eve on Fourth Street in Louisville with my mom, dad, and brother Jon. Even though it was killing me not to be with James that night, it was nice to be with my family. It was the first New Years I spent with both of my parents together that I have any recollection of. I just wish my older brother Joe could have been there as well....and Micki of course. :-) The street was packed and a live band was playing. They even had a ball drop at midnight. I would highly recommend New Years on Fourth Street. Just know that every bar is a $30 cover.... restaurants are free.\n5. I got my Concealed Carry License! I went shooting several times, then took my classes with Jensine and Jamie at Woodhill Training which I would highly recommend. They made the classes interesting. I was expected something like drivers ed where you just sit and read from a book for 8 hours straight. It was not like that at all. They set you up in different scenarios where you are getting money out of an ATM when someone confronts you. Sometimes you got attacked, sometimes he just asked for the time. Every situation was different so it was interesting to see how everyone responded to the scenarios. You also have to shoot 30 rounds at the class. Some of the people who attended had never shot before which meant that they needed a lot of help. The shooting portion was very structured. You had to load for first clip and wait for further instructions. Once you shoot your first 10 rounds, you are asked to load your next clip. Halfway through my second clip, the instructor asked me to run in place while shooting. Still made every shot well within the target. Jensine and Jamie did the same.\nNow I just need to figure out what to do these next four months. :-)",

    "context": "'The Monster Squad' Is Thirty or Wolfman's Got Mindhole Blowers!\nBy Jodi Smith | Mindhole Blowers | September 20, 2017 | Comments ()\nBy Jodi Smith | Mindhole Blowers | September 20, 2017 |\nThe Monster Squad was released August 14, 1987. The film featured kids running around unsupervised, fighting monsters, saying curse words, and learning what a virgin was. It was peak 80s family fun. I remember watching it quite a few times and then playing Monster Squad with my cousins. We were pretty effing, rad. Duh.\n1. Shane Black (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) co-wrote the script with director Fred Dekker. The original script opening had zeppelins, machine guns, and pure insanity that would have cost more than the entire film\u2019s budget.\n2. The only lines Black and Dekker wrote together was a line delivered by Horace (Brent Chalem) talking about rocks and birds.\n3. The legendary Stan Winston created the monsters for the film. Since Universal owns the classic movie monsters but passed on the film, Winston had to make subtle changes to avoid copyright infringement. This is why Frankenstein\u2019s Monster has bolts in his temples, Dracula is missing his widow\u2019s peak, and the Wolfman is wolfier, has pointier ears, and balls.\n4. Ashley Bank turned down a role in Fatal Attraction to play little sister Phoebe. Duncan Regehr, Dracula, didn\u2019t want to frighten the five-year-old, so he didn\u2019t wear his spooky contacts and teeth on set with her. In the scene where Dracula lifts up Phoebe and she screams, the young actress was actually terrified to see Regehr in full monster mode, as he had put in the contacts and fangs.\n5. Liam Neeson was up for the role of Dracula, but clearly lost out to Regehr. Another small role was supposedly planned for Neeson but never filmed.\n6. Jon Fries played The Wolfman. You may also know him as Uncle Rico in Napolean Dynamite.\n7. Tom Woodruff Jr. was working on the film on the Wolfman animatronics. When the film had not yet filled the role of Gillman, Woodruff offered his services. At the end of the flick, the townspeople are really beating the crap out of Gillman. The props were soft on the outside, but hard inside and the beating was really wearing on Woodruff, physically and mentally.\n\u201cThey were wailing on him,\u201d Rose recalled. \u201cThey\u2019d stop and Tom would just say through the Gill mask \u2018Hey guys, do you mind just taking it easy a little bit?\u201d Alas, these pleas fell on deaf ears. After a few tiring takes, Rose remembers that, \u201cOne of the bigger guys was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d Since Woodruff\u2019s vision was limited by the suit, he didn\u2019t see the stunt man and accidentally slugged him right in the face.\n\u201c[He] fell like a sack of potatoes, straight on his a**,\u201d said Rose. For a few unsettling moments, the stunt man just laid there with a glazed look in his eyes. Evidently, there was a pair of badly-placed rivets on the inside of his helmet. The blow drove these into his forehead and, once the hat was removed, two streams of blood spurted forth. Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t seriously hurt.\n8. Scary German Guy\u2019s backstory was apparently thought of as controversial back in 1987. Dekker said that showing the Holocaust tattoo on SGG\u2019s arm was a way to show realism in the midst of such a crazy fantasy story.\n9. Clearly even Dekker wasn\u2019t sure what he was going for, other than kids and classic monsters.\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying now Dracula\u2019s MO, which I\u2019m unclear about. He\u2019s got a car. He\u2019s planned to have this crate shipped. It\u2019s clearly a nefarious plan. I just have no idea what it really is.\u201d -Fred Dekker\n10. The movie was only in theaters for two weeks and only made $3.7 million. It was not released on DVD until its twentieth anniversary, which is when I bought it.\nSources: Mental Floss, Geek Tyrant, Film School Rejects, IMDB.\nGet entertainment, celebrity and politics updates via Facebook or Twitter.

When we did decide to start a family, we thought that we would start our family the \u201ceasy way\u201d first. We soon discovered that I could not get pregnant.\nLooking back, I feel like the desire that both of us shared to adopt was God\u2019s way of leading us to his ultimate gift of our JJ (John Junior).\nOur journey\nInitially, we looked into foster care with hopes of adopting locally. It became clear quickly that foster care was not a good fit for us. Although we were understood that adoption is a slow process, we are not willing to take on the uncertainty that foster care to adoption presented. After much prayer and research, we choose to adoption internationally.\nWe chose Holt International as our adoption agency. Holt is an Oregon based agency that has offices around the world. Their goal is not only to match families but also to provide support for waiting children and their caregivers. Holt\u2019s staff was amazing. They patiently walked us through all of the paperwork and didn\u2019t mind that I had them on speed dial. We were initially enrolled in the China program, but due to a slowdown in referrals for waiting families, we switched to the Korea program.\nThe process was long and at time frustrating but I would not change one thing. All of the hurdles and paperwork lead us to our boy.\nOur adoption timeline\n- 5/14/07 Mailed application to Holt for the China program\n- 5/2/08 Switched to the Korea program\n- 6/10/08 Logged into the Korea program (we are officially in line now)\n- 4/27/09 Received our referral\n- 9/12/09 Traveled to Korea\n- 9/14/09 Met our JJ and his foster family\n- 9/19/09 JJ forever ours\nOn September 20, 2009, we had the pleasure of introducing our little man to his Grandpa and Grandmas and a few of our close friends. Coming down the escalator at the airport my husband looked like Rafiki presenting Simba on Pride Rock in the Lion King.\nOur family has changed forever with our journey to JJ and we feel so blessed for God\u2019s amazing gift. Nowadays our house is filled with laughter and lots of conversations about super heroes and Pok\u00e9mon and I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.",

    "context": "SUMMARY\nThe effect of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus robusta Sm.) mulch on weed control was investigated in a newly planted, nonirrigated 'Tahitian' lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) orchard in Mililani, Hawaii. Increasing mulch rate resulted in a decrease in weed dry weight and an increase in the tree trunk and limb diameters (combined), limb length, and total leaf count. A mulch rate of 150 tonnes/ha is recommended for providing satisfactory weed suppression and enhancing tree growth.\nINTRODUCTION\nSoil water availability and adequate weed control are two important factors that influence the growth and vigor of young orchard trees. Organic mulches help to conserve soil moisture by providing a protective cover on the soil surface. This has resulted in more vigorous trees by reducing the weed pressure and providing a nutrient-containing material for many orchard crops. Although the benefits of mulches are well documented, obtaining material and the high cost of application have limited its widespread use.\nThe objective of this study was to determine the potential of Eucalyptus robusta Sm. mulch to suppress adequately the weed growth and to enhance tree growth in a newly planted, nonirrigated 'Tahitian' lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) orchard.\nPROCEDURE\nThis study was initiated at Mililani, Hawaii, at an elevation of 340 m with an annual precipitation of 150-200 cm. The field was subsoiled to a depth of 46 cm and disked before tree planting. Two-year old 'Tahitian' lime trees grated onto Citrus volkamericana rootstock were planted in nonirrigated beds approximately 20 cm high with treatment plots 2 m wide by 10 m long. There were two trees centered in each treatment plot spaced at 5 m within rows and 5 m between rows. Trees were planted in blocks oriented in an east to west direction with the blocks in the middle of the orchard with several guard rows.\nTreatments. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with eight replications. All but three main limbs, labeled \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\", were removed from the lime trees at planting. Eucalyptus limbs (maximum diameter 16 cm) and leaves were mechanically shredded into chips approximately 0.25 cm thick by 2 cm wide by 6 cm long and evenly applied to the treatment plots. Eucalyptus mulch rates of 0 (control), 100, 150, and 200 tonnes/ha were used.\nWeed data. Weeds were hand harvested with hoes and sickles from a 0.5 m\u00b2 sample area in the middle of each treatment plot. Sampling times for weed harvests were 169, 232, 302, and 372 days after the trees were planted. All aboveground weed biomass was oven dried at 72\u00b0C for four days and weighed.\nTree data. Tree growth data were taken 10, 113, and 354 days after planting. The trunk diameter of the scion 25 mm above the graft union was measured. Two measurements were recorded at the same height, rotated 90\u00b0 about the trunk axis, and averaged to compensate for irregularities in trunk diameter symmetry. Trunk diameter was added to the sum of the limb diameter of the three limbs, each measured once 5 mm above the trunk/limb union. Lengths of the three limbs were measured from the trunk/limb union to the terminal end of the limbs. The combined limb length was used for analysis. Total leaf count for the three limbs was recorded for each tree. Data was subjected to analysis of variance and trend analysis to determine the effect of increasing levels of mulch on weed weight and tree growth\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWeed dry weight. As the eucalyptus mulch rate increased, the total weed dry weight decreased at the four sampling dates. Eucalyptus mulch at 200 tonnes/ha was highly effective in controlling weeds consistently throughout the 372 days after planting. Even with a large increase in weed dry weight for the other treatments in May (302 days after planting), the 200 tonnes/ha treatment still kept the weed dry weight at a low level. Total weed dry weight decreased linearly with increasing mulch rate at 169 and 372 days after planting. The most effective mulch rate for weed control at 169 and 372 days after planting was 200 tonnes/ha with the more pronounced effect at 372 days.\nTrunk and limb diameters. At 113 and 354 days after planting there was a linear increase in the trunk and limb diameters (combined) as the mulch rate increased. Similarly, as the mulch rate increased, there was a linear increase in the total tree leaf number and limb length. The effect of the mulch was more pronounced at 354 days after planting.\nThe primary objective of a successful weed management program in a newly established lime orchard is to minimize economically the weed competition. This study showed that increasing eucalyptus mulch rate decreased weed dry weight. The 200 tonnes/ha treatment gave excellent results in inhibiting weed growth, an 18% reduction in weed dry weight compared to the 150 tonnes/ha treatment. This may have been partly the results of less weed seed germination due to the greater dampening effect of temperature in the soil beneath the 200 tonnes/ha mulch.\nThis study also showed that increasing eucalyptus mulch rate increased tree growth. Growth responses of the lime trees showed a greater response to the mulch rates at the end than at the beginning of the first growing season. The 200 tonnes/ha treatment did not dramatically increase tree growth compared to the 150 tonnes/ha treatment. At the conclusion of the study, the trees in the 200 tonnes/ha plots showed only a 4% increase in trunk and limb diameters (combined), a 1% increase in leaf number, and an 8% increase in limb length over trees in the 150 tonnes/ha plots.\nIn this study, the roots of the lime trees grew through the surface of the soil into the mulch in the 150 and 200 tonnes/ha treatments. The greater rates of mulch may have provided a source of moisture for the roots of the lime trees. Earthworm populations were considerably higher in the 150 and 200 tonnes/ha treatments than in the 10 tonnes/ha treatment and the control. The mulch also may have provided the worms with a more favorable temperature by insulating them from the desiccating effects of the sun.\nEucalyptus mulch can effectively suppress weed competition and increase tree growth and vigor in a newly planted, nonirrigated 'Tahitian' lime orchard. Rates below 150 tonnes/ha did not provide adequate weed control. All other rates of mulch provided commercially acceptable weed control while enhancing tree growth. The recommended rate of eucalyptus mulch application is 150 tonnes/ha, which adequately suppressed weeds and kept mulching economically feasible.\nTop of page\nK. Kobayashi's main page",

    "context": "Author : John E. Charalambakis\nDate : October 8, 2013\nIt\u2019s a pity that the market participants\u2019 focus is on the childish political theater in Washington D.C. which is nothing but a symptom of a greater problem. Nations like families and individuals should restrain excessive spending habits (especially those that advance vested special interests and have nothing to do with the nation\u2019s various security matters, infrastructure, education, and health), while learning to live within their means and reducing liabilities that will burden future generations. However, it seems that all the focus has been on the here and now, without even considering how the here and now could matter simply because every market participant has a yesterday, a today, and a tomorrow. There is an organic link that ties together the past, the present, and the future. When we subvert this natural order of things, then we suffer the consequences. Eric Arthur Blair (a.k.a. George Orwell) once observed: \u201cHe who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the future, controls the present.\u201d\nThe emphasis on the here and now is another symptom of a fiat money system that is getting old, and thus cannot clearly focus on nearby objects (a.k.a. presbyopia). The impasse observed over budget negotiations in Washington D.C., has raised fears of a technical default. That seems to be an excuse for further monetary accommodation, as The Boston Fed president hinted last week. I do not expect the US to go through a technical default, thus any market drop should be used as an opportunity to buy securities with strong fundamentals and with a viable growth path.\nThe inability to see far away objects (myopia) refers to the ongoing efforts by the US Fed and the ECB to stimulate their respective economies without understanding that no nation or federation of nations has ever been able to survive in the past with a fiat money system. The US Fed operations are bifurcated. The Fed has started tapering through the operations they initiated on September 23rd through repo agreements with their primary dealers, hedge funds, and other institutional players. Through those repo agreements the Fed loans the counter-parties bonds from its portfolio with the promise to buy them back at a higher price. The Fed\u2019s counter-parties use those bonds as collateral to create credit and through the credit creation to increase money supply and keep rates down. Needless to say that each counter-party uses the same bond as collateral for credit creation and that chain can go on for several rounds (re-hypothecating the same collateral for multiple credit creation, which is not only absurd but the real cause that brought the system down in 2008).\nAs the number of participants in that re-hypothecation chain expands (as it did on Sept. 23rd) then a new bubble is created, and bubbles always burst. So we have the bifurcated reality of the Fed continuing to buy \u201cassets\u201d while technically shrinking its balance sheet through the repo agreements.\nI have very little doubt that this will indeed increase money supply and the next several months could become another party for equities and a number of corporate bonds. At the same time, The Fed will continue supporting the ECB through swap agreements and thus assist the ECB in its goal of keeping interest rates down, and especially for its goal of lowering the cost of capital for medium and small EU enterprises (see graph below).\nTherefore, it is my belief that in the foreseeable future markets in their myopic view and without presbyopic lenses will experience new record highs, once the political theater is over.\nMy concern is focused on the period two-three years hence when an elderly person\u2019s myopia glasses have been crushed and the bubble created by expanding the collateral base (via the repo agreements described above) and the re-hypothecation chain, start bursting. Unless the global monetary system prepares itself in the next two-three years by establishing sound money that will be based on hard-assets collateral, my fear is that we may be setting ourselves up for a crisis like no other.\nMaybe, that\u2019s the reason that the Fed still plans to buy record amounts of gold at these low gold prices (which I expect to drop further), as reported by Bloomberg on Monday October 7th. This may be their way of sending us a subliminal message.",

    "context": "Cross posted by Findalis from Monkey in the Middle\nBy Anav Silverman \u2013 Sderot Media Center\nIn a unique show of solidarity, a delegation of 70 Italians, including 24 members of the Italian Parliament visited Sderot this past Monday, December 8. The Italian delegation brought with them a copy of a letter, written by members of the Italian Parliament, addressed to Gilad Schalit, the IDF solider captured two years ago who remains in the hands of Hamas in Gaza.\nIn a press conference facilitated by Sderot Media Center, the Italian delegation, which included members from various Italian political parties, presented the letter to a representative of the Schalit family, Medi Cohen. Rossana Boldi, President of the Committee on European Affairs, and acting as representative of the group, stated that the letter had been signed by many important members of the Italian Parliament in the hopes of getting the International Red Cross in Rome to hand the letter to Gilad Schalit.\nBoldi cited during the press conference that the International Red Cross had not paid one visit to Gilad Schalit since his capture, and continues to ignore the plight of Sderot residents living under Palestinian rocket fire.\n\u201cIsrael has a right to exist in security,\u201d said Boldi, \u201cand Gilad Schlit has every right to return home.\u201d\nMedi Cohen, speaking on behalf of the Schalit family, responded by stating that a week previously she and other Gilad Schalit supporters protested in front of the Shikma Prison in Ashkelon, which houses Hamas terrorists. \u201cYou could see Palestinian mothers freely entering the prison to visit their imprisoned sons. These Hamas terrorists are treated fairly and according to international law\u2013they receive free medical treatment and proper care from Israeli authorities,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cGilad on the other hand, has been denied everything. Hamas prevents any form of communication with Gilad from the outside word. Gilad has not been allowed to even speak with his family for two years,\u201d said Cohen bitterly.\nDavid Bouskilla, Sderot\u2019s recently elected mayor was also present at the press conference and warmly welcomed the Italian delegation to Sderot. \u201cThe city of Sderot has strong ties with the Italian community,\u201d Bouskilla stated. When Bouskilla was mayor of Sderot eight years ago, he oversaw the building of the only rocket-protected theater in the entire Negev which was funded partly by the Italian Keren Hayesod.\nMayor Bouskilla also added that Sderot residents have been standing alone in the face of continuing Palestinian rockets. \u201cOur children and families are forced to sit and accept this situation, as rockets continue to hit our homes, properties, playgrounds and schools,\u201d said Bouskilla. \u201cIt is more important than ever to have the support of the international community, especially from a country like Italy\u201d he told the Italian delegation.\nIndeed, it was both encouraging and inspiring to see the concern exhibited by the Italian government officials for Sderot civilians in light of the 200 or more Qassam rockets that have been fired against Sderot and the Negev since early November. During the brief stop at the Sderot police station, where hundreds of Qassam rockets are stored away, the Italian delegation expressed their shock at the way life in Sderot has dramatically altered due to the terror generated by Palestinian rocket fire. \u201cIt is disturbing to think how Israeli children must live in this kind of reality,\u201d said one Italian official.\nIn the scheme of world affairs, Sderot children at least have a few friends back in the Italian Parliament.\nFrom Monkey in the Middle:\nIt is nice to see that the Children of Sderot have a few friends in the world since they have none in the Olmert government. No matter how they plea and cry, Olmert will not even try to stop the rocket attacks that have been occurring daily for the past 8 years.\nBut you can help. Write your Representatives in Congress demanding that the US do something to force the end to these attacks. Write your Senator. And you can give a small donation to the Sderot Media Center. You can give a child of Sderot a little Christmas/Hanukkah gift. It would be a nice gesture in support.\nFiled under: Gaza, Hamas, Italiian Parliament, rockets, Sderot, Sderot Media Center, Western Negev | Comments Off on Italian MPs Show Solidarity in Sderot",

I want to do a hard core workout eat a pizza and then go put on my \"skinny\" pants. It makes me so sad that it doesn't work like that.\nI was fed up with doing random workouts and not really sweating. I need to sweat like I'm being walked to the electrical chair to feel like I did something. Jillian did this for the first few weeks but then blah.

He stands up and laughs when we are jumping around and crying at the same time.\nI plan to do stats every other week. The first phase is 5 weeks and then the second phase is 5 weeks.

It may not be said in so many ways, but from that statement alone it sounds like Blizzard has already looked at the technical aspects of the 360, and determined that it just wouldn\u2019t work.\nBut, that\u2019s not all of the bad news. In the interview with CVG, Street also pointed a finger at the closed nature of Xbox LIVE in of itself. He says that there would have to be some major discussions between them and Microsoft, before anything even remotely could get kicked off. There\u2019s no hiding the fact that Microsoft hasn\u2019t been putting any real focus on MMO titles, and the Redmond-based company is still against letting gamers play cross-platform titles.\nBlizzard seems to be at two different points with bringing an MMO to the Xbox 360. First, it sounds like they don\u2019t believe the console would be even capable of running a title. But, on the other side of the coin, even if they could manage to get a game up and running, it is Xbox LIVE\u2019s inherent nature that prevents them from making it happen.

However, this weekend's defeat to arch-rivals Liverpool was perhaps the lowest point for him and his players this season.\nLiverpool quite simply outclassed United all over the pitch. They played with much more confidence, pace and skill whilst United lacked creativity or desire.\nThe final 3-0 scoreline could have been far worse and such humiliation in their own back yard would have been unthinkable under Ferguson's reign. This season it is not necessarily a surprise.\nNow United must pick themselves up as they face a crucial week which could go a long way to deciding the fate of David Moyes as their manager. United face a crucial second leg Champions League game against Greek side Olympiakos where they need to overturn a shock 2-0 first leg defeat.\nThen, next Monday, United face Manchester rivals City in a game that could highlight the now big difference between the two teams. United and Moyes surely need to not only improve their performances but will also need to win at least one of these games.\nIn a week's time could we see Moyes on the verge of being sacked if results do not go his way in these big games?\nUnited have been very patient this season, as have their supporters, but you have to wonder how far they are willing to see their decline continue under Moyes especially when they look at their main rivals, City and Liverpool, and see the great strides that these two clubs are making at the moment.\nUnited have very little hope of success this season. The only silverware on offer is the Champions League but even if they can overturn their first leg defeat in Greece it is highly unlikely that they will be able to progress to the final given their current form.\nMoyes, at the very least, will hope for an improvement in performances during the next week and United's supporters will want to see signs that will give them hope for the future.

Like the good DIY, indie rock, mirrorshade cryptopunk rebels they go to great lengths to demonstrate that they are, the Boing Boingers approached the obvious solution and Great Corruptor, ads, with trepidation, soliciting comments and vowing that the site would remain unchanged. And so how, now, has the experiment worked?\nTake a look for yourself. Boing Boing has not only embraced advertising, but appears to be giving it a vigorous reach-around in the process.\nThe front page of Boing Boing currently features one banner ad. And three right sidebar graphic ads. And three left sidebar graphic ads. And a text ad. And an ad to place an ad. And ads in the RSS feed. And five \u201cpersonal project\u201d badges that are for things that you can buy. And one conference, one ISP and two tool references \u2014 it\u2019s unclear if there\u2019s any quid pro quo going on. And, inexplicably, a link to Fark. Is it an ad? A reciprocal link? No clue. The site doesn\u2019t say.\nBoing Boing is obviously doing well. They\u2019ve got \u2014 depending on how you count \u2014 between nine and nineteen ad slots, all of them filled. They\u2019re the NASCAR of the weblogging world. And, hey, great. Good for them.\nBut, last year, the ostensible purpose for exploring \u201csponsorship, context-sensitive text-ads, etc.\u201d was to \u201csurvive,\u201d to \u201cre-invest in Boing Boing,\u201d to \u201ccover our costs,\u201d to \u201ccover the costs of hosting.\u201d\nThey\u2019re pretty obviously well beyond these goals. It\u2019s all of a hundred bucks a month for 1.2 terabytes of bandwidth (or about 150% of what the site currently needs), server included. Given February\u2019s 14.5 million pageviews, each advertiser \u2014 taking the low number above \u2014 would have to pay less than a tenth of a cent CPM. It would be easier for everybody involved \u2014 if the goal was to cover costs \u2014 to let one sponsor buy the machine and give them a small, tasteful badge on the front page.\nBut that\u2019s not the goal anymore, is it?\nOK, fine. Boing Boing is profitable. Probably very profitable. It\u2019s not many sites written \u201cfor my friends and my family\u201d that need bookkeepers and reader surveys.\nSo where\u2019s the money going?\nOh, wait, that\u2019s none of our business. Boing Boing isn\u2019t public. They, legally and ethically, owe nobody an explanation for what they do or how they do it.\nExcept it feels sort of wrong, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s got the same indie-Orwell feel that calling their business manager a \u201cband manager\u201d has: We\u2019re not corporate! We\u2019re rebels! We\u2026 make a lot of money.

Looking at the multi window it seems fairly easy to spawn three windows all fullscreen and I assume assign them to different screens? Second question is if I can setup one 3D scene and have each screen render it from a different camera so I can then project the three as one seamless view? I am trying to determine feasibility before diving in so any advice is deeply appreciated.\nMultiwindow, same scene but different cameras?\nWhat\u2019s the graphics card? You\u2019ll have a much simpler time if you can manage to use the drivers to make a virtual desktop that spans multiple displays. I\u2019ve been using NVidia Mosaic for this, which requires something in the Quadro series, but I believe there is something similar with GTX cards too (Surround, maybe?).\nOther than that, you can also manually size just one window to span all three displays, and make it borderless, but this doesn\u2019t work near as nice as a fullscreen app with one window.\nIf you have multiple windows, you\u2019ll have multiple gl contexts, so handling resources across the three of them becomes more complicated.\ncheers,\nRich\nThank you for the feedback! I am trying to pull this off on an early 2013 MBP with an NVIDIA GT 650M. On top of that, MacOS is going to limit the use of the good drivers.\nThis is the route I will try, but why do you say this is not as nice?\nWhat about the tactic of rendering to one large FBO and then each display/window uses a piece of it?\nHi,\nI have been away from Cinder for a while, busy with other stuff, so forgive me in advance if it\u2019s not working, but I have a sample that does what you want:\nAt the very least, you could have a look at it for ideas. It\u2019s pretty easy to render the same scene in multiple windows, but you\u2019ll have to understand that you\u2019re going to do the same work multiple times and performance will be an issue. Make sure to draw the least amount of polygons by performing culling where possible. I don\u2019t think culling is part of the sample, but you\u2019ll find some culling code in the samples that come with Cinder. Let us here on the forum know if you have more questions.\n-Paul\nEdit: Rich\u2019s suggestion to use proper hardware is the better way of doing things. If that proves impossible or too expensive, try rendering to an\nFbo first, then copying the correct portion to each window. The solution in the sample above should actually be your last resort. But it might be of interest nonetheless.\nProblem with rendering to a single\nFbo first is that it requires more memory and, additionally, you can\u2019t share the\nFbo across each of the window\u2019s graphic contexts. However, you can share the actual texture used by the\nFbo.\nOne small thing, OSX by default enforces a window to belong to a specific display, so calling\ngetWindow()->spanAllDisplays() won\u2019t work unless you disable this setting.",

Griff, the clubs owner, knows exactly what he\u2019s going through as he\u2019s already been there himself. Changing from mortal to immortal for incubi and succubi are practically the same. With the thought that he\u2019s saving her life in mind, he sets off to help her complete her change.\nThis isn\u2019t my favourite novelette. If you like a very erotic book with not much else. This story only covers a week, but most of the story is over in a day. The characters aren\u2019t developed past the need of the story. Since there isn\u2019t really one it ends at their very shallow relationship. The sex scenes are good, so if you\u2019re looking for that it\u2019s fine. I feel like even smut needs a little more of a story. This isn\u2019t a book I\u2019d recommend sadly\u2026 on to the second one!\nRhyan is an angel who\u2019s been sent to Earth as punishment. She has been given the task of collecting information on Dominic, a fallen angel that has still retained all of his powers. As Dominic works at Desire, he has not problem picking up ladies when he wants a little one on one time. However, once Rhyan walks into the club he is hit with a desire that is unknown to him. Now, both Rhyan and Dominic have to decide what\nThis is actually quite good in comparison to the 1st book. The story is interesting and the characters are well developed. Tompkins got the balance between smut and story down in this book. The sub plot behind Rhyan\u2019s arrival is nice and interesting. It\u2019s refreshing to see a plot about Fallen angels. I guess it only makes sense that he\u2019s friends with a incubus and a djinn. I do like the interactions between the 3 friends.\nSeth is a fire djinn, and the most dominant of the doms on the Atlanta scene. Thanks to his gig as manager of Desire, he doesn\u2019t have any trouble getting a woman. Eden is a witch priestess who has been force to into great power with out really wanting it. The night before she takes the place as the Elemental Guardian, she seeks out Seth in order to let go. However, though they simply wanted some good sex they both get more than what they bargained for.\nThis book is about 1/2 between the 2nd and the 3rd book. I loved the accurate depiction of BDSM that is displayed at the beginning of the story. When they roles switch it was a little less willing. There was a story but it simply fuel the sex. Similar to the first book, it is all sex all the time, however, this book we do get more character development then the first book. I still prefer the 2nd book though out of all of them.",

In short, the Helgian\" triadic structure is a sneaky, political trick to foist socialist programs on the masses: THESIS, ANTITHESIS, and SYNTHESIS. Thesis: is a proposition stated or put forward for consideration, especially one to be discussed and proved or to be maintained against objections. Antithesis: Opposite or objection to the thesis. Synthesis: THE BIG SCAM. A compromise between thesis and antithesis.\n1. THESIS: In 2009 Barrack Obama and Democrat party, assisted by the Supreme Court, rammed Obamacare (resurrected Kennedycare and Hillarycare) down our collective throats. We-the-people responded by throwing the Democrat majority out of office in a series of three election cycles.2. ANTITHESIS: Shortly after the American people began voicing their objection to Obamacare. In 2010 Republican hopefuls began campaigning against Obamacare and vowed to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. We-the-people responded by voting these Republicans into office at the U.S. Legislature and Administration levels.3: SYNTHESIS: 2017: After giving the Republicans the White House and the majority in both Houses of Congress, all but a few conservative Republicans in the House and Senate reneged on their campaign promises to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. They, instead, have acquiesced to tweak Obamacare (called Obamacare-light) and have even made this monstrosity worse by adding a crony-capitalism provision to set $200 million aside to bail-out the Insurance companies (another government subsidy).(The U.S. government either has not learned its lesson or are efforting to steal, again, from the American people. If a company is too big to fail, it should be broken up into smaller pieces--period! No more \"too big to fail\" companies; no more bailouts. STOP BIG GOVERNMENT'S \"TOO BIG TO FAIL\" SCAM!)\nSo, here we all are, again, at the crossroads of fascist socialism (communism) and free enterprise, free-market capitalism. WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT YOUR NATION TO GO, AMERICANS, AND HOW HARD ARE YOU WILLING TO FIGHT FOR IT?!? I stand with Sen. Paul on this one; we must bring our Republican lawmakers to account, compelling them to either live up to their campaign promises--first REPEAL and then REPLACE OBAMACARE or leave office! And if they don't do either, it is up to us to throw both the deceiving obstructionist Democrats AND deceitful Republicans out of office and start over with new lawmakers who promise to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE and will live up to their promises.Group Insurance plans worked well in the past for all who work; so why get rid of them? Care Cooperatives may be the future for assuring affordable health care to all Americans who can't get group health insurance. Check out the new medical care paradigm of Josh Empehr, M.D. for instance:\"After completing training and becoming a board certified Family Physician, I opened Atlas MD, a practice that I had been dreaming about for nearly a decade. Atlas MD represents my ideal medical practice where I\u2019m able to shrug off the burdens and restrictions of government and insurance regulation so I can focus solely on my patients and their needs.\"Final note: If U.S. Health Care is, indeed, too expensive for the American people, it is primarily because the U.S. Medical industry is a monopoly, NOT based on free enterprise, free-market capitalism, as all commerce was intended to be by our Founding Fathers. Perhaps it, too, must be broken up into smaller pieces so that it does become competitive and affordable. The Medical, Insurance and Pharmaceutical industries are all, basically monopolies that support one-another, all made possible by our beloved federal government. They are all part of the health care problem. The Medical, Insurance and Pharmaceutical industries are simply making too much money off the backs of the American people. Their profits must come down if the U.S. is ever to have a viable health care system that works for ALL the people. And the only way this will occur, in my opinion, is through competition. The competition: Alternative or Naturopathic Health Care and Healthcare cooperatives. Your AMA doctors and nurses know nothing about alternative healthcare, so don't bother asking them about it. Orthodox Medicine (Medical, Insurance, and Pharmaceutical industry) only know how to manage disease, not cure it. Alternative or Naturopathic Health Care is growing up in the shadows of Orthodox Medicine, despite the best efforts of the AMA and the U.S. government to kill, cull, injure, and/or not allow it to grow. Ones who want to learn about alternative/naturopathic health care and health care cooperatives must do their own research; each must seize responsibility for their own physical and mental health.\n***Related:Exclusive \u2013 Sen.

And when I saw it on display at a bookstore, I was intrigued. Congratulations on getting praises from J.K. Rowling. She may be one of the reasons why I bought the book\u2014but she isn\u2019t why I kept reading it. I kept at it because the book looked promising.\nAs I began reading chapter one, a particular question kept popping in my head: how do two authors write one story?\nI\u2019ve worked on articles with other people. Sometimes it\u2019s easy. Other times, it\u2019s not. So how did the two of you divide the work? You separated the story arcs or chapters? Whichever method you used, how did you keep the characters\u2019 personalities faithful from the start until the end? Did both of you conceive all the characters or were some contributions from just one of you? That\u2019s possible, right? And\u2014if it is\u2014then when the other guy who did not contribute the particular character wrote about said character, was the rendition as accurate as possible as the first conception? Or did you have to consult each other every single time for the characters\u2019 quips, movements, emotions, and thoughts? As for the consultation, didn\u2019t you find that bothersome or just dismiss as part of the process?\nHad you worked on this alone, what would have changed?\nEnough of my questions, though. I have no idea if anyone has told you this but\u2014upon meeting the Walker kids and discovering their traits\u2014I couldn\u2019t shake off the idea that I was reading some sort of nod to the Baudelaire kids of Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events (ASOUE). A trio of orphans (for a while), the eldest is a smart girl, middle child is boy with a great memory, and the youngest is an almost fearless girl, whose adventures started because their house was destroyed and they have to battle terrible forces to get a happy ending.\nPlus, House\u2019s paperback version has the same frayed edges that the pages of the hardback version of the ASOUE have.\nWell, anyway, I agree with Rowling. House did offer such a fast-paced adventure. And I did have that feeling that it wouldn\u2019t end with just one book. It was one kind of a rollercoaster ride. Although it is likely that I may not read the next one, I wish you both the best with the sequel. Or is it sequels? Whichever.\nSincerely,\nMati Serra\u00f1o\n3 Comments Add yours You have been nominated for several awards! Congratulations! Jill\nThanks you so much!\n\ud83d\ude00",

    "context": "How awake are you?\nThe end of the year is just a few weeks away, and a new liturgical year has just started. The season of Advent is upon us. New Apostolic services in the month of December are dedicated to the theme \u201cTime of fulfilment\u201d. Following is a closer look at what to expect.\nPeople need hope. Without hope no one can survive. Despair discourages, makes you weak, and it paralyzes. Without hope a future is hardly conceivable. This is true for all people in all countries, and at all times. We need to be inspired with hope either by somebody or something\u2014either by a promise, a Messiah, or a goal. The ancient Israelites waited centuries for the promised Messiah. The prophets kept this alive in them. Even greater than Moses, this new Messiah was to proclaim God\u2019s future plan of salvation to the people of the old covenant. What was left in the end? The hope in the coming Messiah faded. It died, was forgotten.\nWhen it comes to Him, opinions are divided\nAnd then He came, Christ. But there was widespread and powerful unbelief, especially since this Jesus came from Nazareth, was born in the small village of Bethlehem, and came from a family of craftsmen. The tiny flicker of hope barely had a chance against so much rejection. There were only a few people who believed and followed Jesus, and listened to His teachings.\nThe dawn of a new day\nAnd today? What does this have to do with us? Earlier it was the Jews who waited for Him, today also Christians are waiting for Him. Jesus Christ promised eternal life. He spoke of His resurrection and return. That is what makes Advent so meaningful: Christians are preparing for the return of Christ. The day is at hand, He will be here soon. This wake-up call has lost none of its urgency. A fitting image is the approach of dawn. A dark night is followed by a new day. Paul uses this image to show that the return of Christ is inexorable. It may still be midnight, but the dawn of a new day cannot be prevented: \u201cThe night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light\u201d (Romans 13: 12).\nThe King is coming\nWe are talking about nobody less than the King of kings, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. \u201cHosanna! \u2018Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!\u2019 The King of Israel!\u201d (John 12: 13) Jesus is not a king elected by human beings. Neither is He a king who has descended from a human dynasty. His kingship is a divine one. He rules, but without force. He judges, but does not condemn. He is the King of peace.\nNothing is impossible for God\nWith this in mind, we can begin to understand Mary\u2019s faith: \u201c\u2018For with God nothing will be impossible.\u2019 Then Mary said, \u2018Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.\u2019 And the angel departed from her\u201d (Luke 1: 37\u201338). This is the Bible text for Christmas Day 2016.

    "context": "By Anthony McClean, Editor In Chief Emeritus\nNEW HAVEN \u2014 As 2017 comes to a close and 2018 sits in waiting, another college basketball season has begun. It comes with its predictable storylines and outcomes both on and off the court.\nWhether it\u2019s the scandalous nature of some head and assistant coaches across the country or the puzzling decisions of young adults overseas, the college hoop campaign has already been an interesting, if not sobering affair.\nMuch like the rap by A Tribe Called Quest or the TV show \u201cNaked City\u201d, there always seems to be \u201ceight million stories\u201d that can be told or written about any given player in college hoops.\nThis is one of them. But it\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t get told often enough.\nIt\u2019s about perseverance and sacrifice.\nIt\u2019s also about opportunity and commitment.\nAnd finally, it\u2019s about the everlasting love and the bond between a mother and her son.\nFor Mikol Blake-Green of Fisher College, the season has slowly given him a chance to relax and feel comfortable on and off the court. A native of Boston, the 6-foot-7 forward has been getting consistent minutes for the Falcons, an NAIA independent.\nHowever, the road to this destination has been without its obstacles and pitfalls.\nDuring his past athletic endeavors, Mikol has seen the ugly side of sports. During his days of playing Pop Warner football in Cambridge, he saw his coach shot and killed on the field during a dispute.\nHe\u2019s also lost many teammates over the years due to the violence in his community. Its impact has left an indelible mark on Mikol. He\u2019s had to deal with issues of anxiety and other effects of his formative years.\n\u201cI felt like I was angry all the time. Sports always gave me the chance to relax and express myself\u201d, said Mikol.\nHe was also taking on extra responsibilities as well.\nHis mother, Veola, served as a child welfare worker in Boston. She was also awarded legal guardianship of her younger brother and two sisters. Along the way, Mikol helped his mother while also working, attending school, and taking care of his relatives.\nIt was a heavy burden on a young teenager, but because of his devotion to his mom, it was something that he felt more than obligated to do. \u201cMikol is a good person with a beautiful heart and a kind soul\u201d, said Veola.\nWhen he eventually graduated from high school following a stellar basketball career, Mikol enrolled at nearby Bunker Hill Community College. Along the way, he would meet two men who would have a great influence on his life on and off the court.\nHead Coach Nkrumah Jones and his assistant, Leroy Gibson served as mentors for Mikol who was seeking guidance and knowledge. \u201cWhen I first got to Bunker Hill, I definitely had some trust issues and was very emotional\u201d, said Mikol.\n\u201cThey talked to me like no one had ever done before. They were upfront about everything and I took an initial liking to them\u201d. Coach Gibson first met Mikol at a local barbershop owned by his cousin.\nGibson and Mikol had a long conversation about basketball and life. He felt like Mikol was someone who was looking for help. \u201cTo me, the most important thing was to give him an opportunity to work on his overall growth\u201d, said Gibson.\n\u201cLike many kids, he had some issues that we dealt with early on. It was just a matter of showing him the ropes and how we do things here. You help them make the adjustment, but a lot of it falls on the individual.\u201d\nCoach Jones added that seeing Mikol make the emotional transition on and off the court was something that he\u2019s the proudest of. \u201cHe definitely had a bit of a chip on his shoulder when he arrived here\u201d, he added.\n\u201cHowever, we slowly developed some trust amongst each other along the way. It definitely made our relationship grow as a whole. The biggest thing I tried to impress upon him was building relationships.\u201d\nMikol added, \u201cI had never received that sort of guidance before that I got from Coach Jones and Coach Gibson. They both made me a better player and help me apply those lessons on the court to apply to life as well.\u201d\nThose lessons would come in handy in regards to the next major event of his life. Along the way at Bunker Hill, his mother would get a job offer in Baltimore. Mikol decided to stay in Massachusetts while also planning on what his next move academically was going to be.\nEventually, he decided to attend Daniel Webster College in Nashua, New Hampshire. Unfortunately, things got off to a bad start for Mikol. He was a victim of racial profiling early on.\nWhile coming home from work, Mikol was pulled over by six police officers with guns drawn because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a potential suspect. As we previously mentioned, Mikol is a 6-foot-7 black man with a beard.\nThe potential suspect was a 30-year-old black man standing 5-feet-6 and clean shaven.\nEarlier in the year, the school would eventually shut down due to financial issues. While many of the staff and students would transition to nearby Southern New Hampshire University, Mikol decided to move elsewhere.\nHere again is where his mother used her influence to determine his fate. Mikol and Veola looked to Fisher College back in Massachusetts as an opportunity. Ms. Green would send a very open and emotional letter pleading Mikol\u2019s case.\nHere\u2019s a small excerpt:\n\u201cWe believe Fisher College is the choice for him. And I believe in him. Please help my son. Please save his life. Mikol is a star that needs space to develop and supporters to guide him so that he may shine brightly. Mikol has a plan and that plan includes being in a position to support and pay it forward to invest in children \u2014 by giving them what he lacked.\u201d\nEventually, the school would accept Mikol as a student-athlete. When his playing days are done, he\u2019s hoping to become a coach. In his own way, he\u2019ll be paying back the many people along the way that have helped him.\nFor the many student-athletes that play collegiate sports, Mikol\u2019s story is all too common. We always hear about the All-Americans or the All-Conference standouts. But for many others, their stories are seldom told or seldom heralded.\nThe final chapter has yet to be written on Mikol Blake-Green. The best is yet to come.\nAnthony McClean can be reached via email at anthonymcclean@basnnewsroom.com.",

For example, local temporary matrix variables are mapped to wires, whereas persistent matrix variables are mapped to registers.\nThe latter tends to be an inefficient mapping when the matrix size is large, since the number of register resources available is limited. It also complicates synthesis, placement and routing.\nModern FPGAs feature block RAMs that are designed to have large matrices. HDL Coder takes advantage of this feature and automatically maps matrices to block RAMs to improve area efficiency.

    "context": "Black Lives Matter: Eric Garner\u2019s Death & Questions That Remain\nLooking over from the African continent, it has not always been easy for many to fully understand the circumstances of Black Americans or even the history of race relations in the United States. After all, many assume America is a country of freedom, laden with opportunities and wealth for all. However, how does one account for the complaints from the Black American community along with the commensurate apparent disparities in opportunities and treatment?\nOn July 17, 2014, police officers of the New York Police Department (NYPD) approached 43 year old Eric Garner under the suspicion of hawking cigarettes along the road, an act New York City frowns strongly upon because it undermines their deliberately exorbitant taxation policies on discouraged products. After engaging in an argument with Mr. Garner, who pleaded several times with the officers to \u201cleave him alone,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m minding my business officer, I\u2019m minding my business.\u201d \u201cEvery time you see me, you want to mess with me.\u201d His pleas were insufficient to the police who were determined to take him down. He was grappled to the ground and suffocated in a banned chokehold; once again he began to plead, this time for his life. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The officers ignored his pleas and pushed his head against the concrete, while his life slowly drifted away from him and out of his reach. It was not long before Garner was pronounced dead.\nThe fallout was immediate. The primary culprits responsible for killing Garner \u2014 Daniel Pantaleo and Justin D\u2019Amico were placed on desk duty. While awaiting a grand jury decision on whether to indict the police officer, the city medical examiner came back with a verdict months later \u2014 the death was ruled a homicide. On December 13, 2014, the grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo for Garner\u2019s death. Protests broke out in New York City and across the United States. Highways were blocked off to traffic and protesters peacefully demonstrated in the streets.\nIt was especially painful to the Black American community, as this failure to indict came shortly after another failure to indict in the death of Ferguson teenager, Michael Brown. In addition to this, 12 year old Tamir Rice from Ohio was gunned down within two seconds of arrival by police officer Tim Loehmann; like every other kid, Tamir was playing by the park with his toy gun when he was shot. Regardless of whoever is right or wrong, in any of these cases, the Black American community has noted a system that has historically targeted them unfairly, especially black men.\nThere are a number of issues with the Eric Garner case that immediately come to the forefront in the minds of many. First of all, why was Panteleo\u2019s case not taken to trial despite the fact that the medical examiner had clearly ruled Garner\u2019s death a homicide? The New York Police Department (NYPD) had taken steps in July to retrain the police force against the banned chokehold, which clearly shows that Panteleo\u2019s actions implied error, and the presence of very clear video evidence which shows the police officers killing the man while the cameraman protested the unfair arrest. It is understandable that this was the jury\u2019s decision to make, but who were these individuals? Secondly, why was this officer left on the NYPD payroll despite a history of being sued three times in the past for violating the rights of Black Americans? Despite the race or color of the police officers, or even that of the victim\u2019s, there is no reason why this homicide should not have gone to trial. No one should have to die for hawking petty goods along the street \u2014 in the grand scheme of things there are more serious atrocities that occur daily but go unnoticed.\nWhat do these recent incidents mean for black men in America? For parents with young sons, will having the talk have to shift from a discussion about the \u201cbirds and the bees\u201d to \u201chow to not get shot\u201d?\nOne thing is certain. The uprising following the deaths of Garner and Brown prove the power of civil society, for better or worse. There remains some hope that all Americans can leverage what has been positive from the demonstrations to promote an understanding of race relations in the United States. Americans of good ethics, including Black Americans need to be more involved in civil society and continue to highlight and celebrate what is positive. Jury duty should never be seen as a chore, but rather a part of the democratic process wherein homicidal officers with a history of poor policing are brought to justice. Further measures recommended include proper training of the police force, the elimination of the irrational fear of black individuals, civil recourse in the case against Pantaleo, and compensation to the Garner family, even though no amount of money can replace the pain from the unnecessary death of a man who was a husband, father and a son. However at the end of the day, change will have to begin at home. Black businesses, families and communities need to rally their support in building a greater sense of community, unity and support while actively challenging negative stereotypes and perceptions.\nBlack lives do matter. It is important that these measures are taken sooner rather than later, as the next time could be anytime.\nImage: Getty/AP/Reuters/LA Times",

    "context": "eye makeup, makeup tips, mature skin, skincare\nQ: \u201cHi Kristina,\nHere\u2019s a question. Can you do a post on doing eye make up for older eyes? My mother has expressed that she\u2019s struggling to work out how to do make-up and what types and colours to wear now that she\u2019s older. Metallics don\u2019t generally look as good, so are there some good matte shadow palettes she could look into? What kind of priming should be done to avoid makeup falling into the creases? Are there any make up techniques she could try to make her eyes look more youthful, beyond just using eye cream?\nThanks,\nEllen\u201d\nA: Hi Ellen!\nGreat question! When it comes to makeup for mature aged eyes, the first rule is to make sure the skin around this area is in tip-top condition so the wrinkles and crow\u2019s feet look less pronounced. For a fast fix, a hydrating eye cream which contains retinol (try Clinicians Complex Retinol Eye Cream) will plump up the skin and smooth lines while a serum containing peptides such as Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum will help to rebuild the surface and protect it against future damage. But the best time-fighitng tool which helps to significantly reduce dark circles, puffiness and boost circulation is to massage the area each night with an eye cream that contains a metal applicator like Givenchy No Surgetics Plasti Sculpt Lifting Gel Eye De Puffer.\nWhen it comes to selecting an eye shade and formula, it\u2019s best to stay away from textures that are too bright, metallic, glittery or wet as they exaggerate fine lines. Matte or satin textures in netural tones are most flattering. For matte, I recommend Christian Dior 5 Color Designer All In One Artistry Palette in No. 708 Amber Design and for a velvet satin finish, opt for Guerlain Ecrin 4 Couleurs Long Lasting Eyeshadow in #07 Les Cuirs or for a variation of colours, try Jane Iredale Perfectly Nude Eye Shadow Kit.\nTo make the eyes appear youthful and gorgeous, gently shade in the crease and the outer corner of the eye, blending slightly upwards to give an impression that the eye tilts up, reversing the downwards droop. This will also help to brighten the eyes and disguise weariness.\nLining the lashes also becomes increasingly important as we age. The use of a pencil or gel liner (preferably in brown as black can be too full on) will help to open the peepers right up. Steer clear of liquid liners as these do not sit well with skin creases.\nIf your mother\u2019s eyes are round or are starting to droop, she can create lift by directing the eyeliner slightly upwards on the outer edges of the lash line, as opposed to following the natural shape when applying her makeup. If her inner rims are starting to redden, she can conceal this with a skin-toned eye pencil and follow with two coats of volumising mascara to help restore fullness to the lashes. Focus on the base of the lash; don\u2019t place a heavy load of mascara on the tips of the lashes or they\u2019ll look clumpy and heavy.\nAlso, fuller, deeper brows give the appearance of an instant face-lift. Try a shadow or brow pencil that\u2019s close to the hair colour to fill in the arches brows. If you\u2019re using a powder, apply with a stiff angled brush pressing into the bare spots and blend with a spoolie brush or clean mascara wand.\nFinally, avoid using foundation or powder on crow\u2019s feet. Instead, distract from them by dabbing concealer only where needed \u2014 in the discoloured areas around the eyes and face. Lancome Long-Lasting Softening Concealer helps soften the look of undereye circles and visibly eliminates the signs of stress and fatigue, while making the eyes look well rested. Use a small, flat makeup brush to apply the concealer in the dark area and gently pat\u2014don\u2019t massage or rub\u2014the concealer on the discoloured area. If you try to massage the concealer in, you\u2019ll pull and stretch your eye area\u2019s delicate skin..",

Using a hydrating eye cream with retinol and a serum with peptides can help smooth lines and protect the skin.

    "context": "[.]\nOne of the best ways to get involved in the collector-car hobby is to attend a local car show or cruise-in. Car shows and cruise-ins are great places to look for a classic or muscle car. Although many car shows do not allow any advertising of cars for sale, owners may be looking for a prospective buyer for a sale in the future, or know of a car similar to theirs that is for sale by another owner. If you do find a car that is available, a car show is a great venue for seeing a prospective purchase in person and to talk at length to the owner. This buying experience is much more desirable than buying a car from pictures online or from a classified advertisement. So what\u2019s the difference between all these events?\nCruise-ins.\nA Concours d\u2019Elegance is a little bit different from a car show or a cruise-in, in that you will find a more consistent showing of quality original and restoration vehicles presented for more intense judging. Concours events often require that participants be members of the sponsoring club or organization or that they submit entry paperwork well in advance of the event. Cars on display at a concours are by invitation only, and are often the very best examples available. Judging is scored by deductions at all AACA-sanctioned events. All cars receive a point rating on each judged item, and then points are deducted based on the appearance (cleanliness, fading or pitting of the chrome, dings or dents, correct bolts, etc.). Other scoring categories include suspension, engine compartment details, wheels, instrument panel, paint, frame and exhaust.\nOne thing that all three events have in common? They\u2019re great places to meet people in the hobby, and a perfect venue to find out what kind of car is right for you. It\u2019s an opportunity to ask questions, whether about a certain make or model, some facet of restoration you\u2019re interested in, a club you might be interested in joining or a restoration shop you\u2019ve heard about. Take the opportunity and run with it. Car people are among the most informative, inclusive and friendly on the planet. If you are thinking of entering a car in one of these events, start by attending a cruise-in or car show before actually entering your car. Experience is the best teacher when it comes to showing your car and winning an award.\nQuestions to Ask:\nWhich event should I be going to if I am new to the hobby?\nYou are always encouraged to attend each one as a spectator; however, if you want to enter your car, a cruise-in is probably the best place to show your car for the first time.\nAre there minimum requirements to enter my car in these events?\nUsually there are no minimum requirements at a cruise-in, but you should check with the event sponsor.\nDo I have to belong to a car club to enter a vehicle?\nCruise-ins and most car shows do not require that you be a member of a car club to enter your vehicle, but you may encounter shows where some of the judging is limited to club members.\nWhat can I expect at my first time showing a car?\nOnce you arrive at the event, car show staff will direct you to the proper parking area and may separate you by the class in which you are entered. Many veterans bring picnic lunches, books or board games to keep them occupied during the judging process, but it\u2019s most often a time to talk with your friends.\nHow can I find out when and where shows are happening in my area?\nOne of the best resources to find an event in your area is through the Events Calendar on Hemmings.com. Every month, the publication devotes 40 to 60 pages of classified ads to upcoming events for the next month, broken down by state.\nCrown\nSecond owner, first car, zero regrets: J-code Mach 1 comes out of retirement\nMarch Military Campaign \u2013 Mutt v.

    "context": "By Kizito Sikuka\nWith clear agricultural policies such as access to inputs including seeds and fertiliser, as well as credit facilities and extension services, smallholder farmers have the capacity to increase production, as has been the case in China.\nAgriculture has been identified by Africa as a priority development area in the China-Africa strategic partnership.\nThe agricultural sector is regarded as an engine for socio-economic development in most African countries.\nAccording to the African Union (AU), agriculture accounts for about one-third of the continent's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and more than two-thirds of its citizens rely directly on the sector for their livelihood.\nCognisant of the important role of agriculture in the development agenda, Africa is redoubling its efforts to invest more in the sector and boost production.\nHowever, the task of transforming agriculture is generally not an easy one. Similar to the struggle for independence, the agricultural drive also requires much more efforts from within Africa as well as outside, particularly from those that have successfully transformed their agricultural sector.\nOne country that has managed to record impressive progress in the agricultural sector is China. Other notable countries in this regard include Argentine, Brazil, India and Tanzania.\nFrom struggling to feed its growing population, China now ranks among the leaders in worldwide farm output, although accounting for less than 10 percent of arable land worldwide.\nOn the other hand, Africa continues to experience some challenges in improving its agricultural sector, yet the continent is endowed with fertile soils, a favourable climate and affluent water basin.\nSo what are the lessons and opportunities for development between China and Africa as the latter has clearly demonstrated to the rest of the world that socio-economic development is possible through agricultural development.\nOne opportunity lies in knowledge and technology transfer and sharing, which is explicitly outlined in the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation (Focac) launched in 2000 and in each three-year plan ever since, where the two sides have agreed to work together in boosting agricultural production in Africa and ensuring food security for its citizens.\nFor example, China pledged to train agricultural technicians and management personnel as well as build agricultural technology demonstration centres in Africa, and had done so in many countries.\nThis commitment is based on the fact that China has achieved an impressive agricultural growth from investment in agriculture research including the development of high-yielding, well-adapted lowland seed varieties, as well as appropriate fertiliser application, and farming machinery to boost production.\nIn this regard, Africa should upscale the use of research in agriculture and not rely on cultivating more land and mobilising a larger labour force to increase production.\nSo far, at least 15 agricultural technology demonstration centres built by China are operational in African countries, in Benin, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Five more centres are expected to be built in countries such as Mali.\nThe agricultural technology demonstration centre in Zimbabwe has trained more than 3 000 farmers since it started operations in 2012.\nAnother important area for China-Africa co-operation in the agricultural sector is infrastructure development, particularly irrigation, transport network and storage facilities.\nNoting that the country had limited land for agriculture, China embarked on a massive drive to ensure that it maximises the little land it had for greater output by embracing the use of irrigation.\nThis is in contrast with Africa where less than 10 percent of the arable land is under irrigation yet the continent is home to more than half of the world's arable land.\nAs a result of the irrigation drive, China is able to conduct its farming activities all year around. It will be critical for Africa to also embrace and heavily invest in irrigation development, and not heavily rely on climatic conditions, because lower precipitation would mean lower yield.\nAfrica has the capacity to increase its irrigation uptake as the continent is hugely endowed with watercourses such as the seven major river systems of Congo, Limpopo, Niger, Nile, Orange, Senegal and Zambezi.\nInvestment in road and rail upgrades will ensure that agricultural produce moves smoothly from one place to another, while establishment of more storage facilities will allow farmers to store their harvest for use in poor seasons.\nAccording to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation post-harvest crop losses are estimated to be as high as 40 percent in Africa, so storage is a challenge to be resolved.\nIn addition to infrastructure development, agricultural co-operation between China and Africa should target smallholder farmers, who are the majority.\nWith clear agricultural policies such as access to inputs including seeds and fertiliser, as well as credit facilities and extension services, smallholder farmers have the capacity to increase production, as has been the case in China.\nAccess to extension services is also critical for planning purposes, especially when farmers want to diversify into new crops or livestock.\nAnother important lesson from Chinese agricultural development is that China was aware that agricultural policy implementations come at a cost.\nTherefore, they were patient with their policies noting that agricultural development should first be aimed at achieving food security before achieving socio-economic development.\nAs a result, agricultural development was an incremental learning process, meaning that any policy was first implemented on a smaller scale, and only when it was successful was it then replicated in other areas as opposed to implementing unproven methods on a larger scale.\nFurthermore, significant agricultural reforms in China were deeply rooted in fully implementing all agreed policies, and the task for African countries is to transform its initiatives into actual implementation.\nThese initiatives include the African Union's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which encourages countries to reach a higher path of economic growth through agriculture-led development by allocating at least 10 percent of their national budgets to the agricultural sector each year.\nThis article from the Southern African Research and Documentation Centre (SARDC) through its Institute for China-Africa Studies in Southern Africa, is part of a series exploring the dimensions of China Africa relations in advance of the Focac Summit to be held in Johannesburg in early December.",

We\u2019re back in the States and Berlin Diary is on hiatus until we ever make it back there. There is scheming afoot, but nothing that will happen in the short term. In fact, we even trailed off writing off over there in our last week and a half. Too much to do, too little time.\nI\u2019ve got a job for the next couple of months, Lisa\u2019s interviewing for work all over the country it seems, and within about two weeks we should hear if we\u2019re going to be able to pitch our Berlin project to a consortium in Norway for funding. I haven\u2019t written about that here and I don\u2019t want to go into any more detail just yet other than to say we\u2019re thrilled with the response we\u2019ve gotten so far. Any more good news and we\u2019ll be beyond thrilled, wherever \u201cbeyond thrilled\u201d happens to be.\nAlso in good news, I\u2019ve finished my current edit/re-draft of The Story of the Story of the Egg and that\u2019s gone out to betas. I\u2019ve started on the query letter and expect to start sending it to agents sometime in the autumn. Good responses from folks so far. The timing with my work is perfect.\nIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019ve dropped the folktale to once a week though \u2013 as it is I\u2019m barely keeping up.\nBut in links-world\u2026\nPeter Han says he\u2019s not an artist but a designer. He works primarily in chalk and he has no compunction about erasing the work that he creates. There\u2019s a short doc on him at Vimeo, Pardon My Dust. Reminded me in his apparent speed of Lisa\u2019s short doc Giorgio, about an Italian street artist \u2013 the trailer is here.\nCreepy and photography come together at Atlas Obscure, one of my favorite sites of the past couple of months, with their short piece on Snake Island.

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nSigned off his couch after Arizona released him, Bruney was a pleasant find for the Yankees last year when he was 1-1 with a 0.87 ERA in 19 games and earned a spot on the postseason roster. Asked if the problem was serious enough to shut him down, Bruney wasn\u2019t sure.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said Bruney, who is slated to throw batting practice today.\nIf the 6-foot-3, 245-pound Bruney is shelved, the Yankees have options. Chris Britton, who came from the Orioles for Jaret Wright, has impressed Joe Torre in mound sessions. Britton, a 6-3, 275-pound right-hander, appeared in 52 games for Baltimore last season. Other options include lefties Ron Villone and Sean Henn and righties Jeff Karstens, T.J. Beam and Darrell Rasner.\n\u201cWe have depth that we haven\u2019t had in a while,\u201d Torre said of his bullpen candidates.\nKarstens and Rasner have starting experience. Sanchez, who pushes the radar guns to 96 mph, impressed Jason Giambi in batting practice Thursday but was scratched yesterday.\n\u201c[The concern with Sanchez is] muscular in the forearm,\u201d Torre said of the 6-foot-6, 270-pound product of South Bronx High School, who came from Detroit in the Gary Sheffield deal. \u201cHe will throw [today].\u201d\nSanchez, who said he was okay, doesn\u2019t figure to make the team out of camp unless the rotation suffers a couple of injuries.\nHe is viewed as a pitcher who can start or relieve. While Sanchez is an imposing figure with a blistering fastball, he isn\u2019t a stranger to injuries.\nIn 2004 he was on the minor league DL with a right knee problem. Three times in 2005 he was on the shelf with a rib cage and groin problems. Last year, a right elbow injury knocked him out.",

    "context": "Winning games in the NFL is never easy. But in the last 19 regular season games, the Kansas City Chiefs have emerged victorious 17 times.\nThe .894-win percentage is best in the NFL in that span, and Kansas City enters week 10 in a first place tie with Oakland in the AFC West and a first place tie in the AFC with New England.\nThe Chiefs don\u2019t have a future hall of fame quarterback, they don\u2019t have a superstar at receiver or running back, they\u2019ve played all year without one of the league\u2019s best pass rushers and given up the 12th most yards on defense in the NFL.\nYet, somehow, week after week, the Chiefs find a way to win games that some say they have no business winning.\nWhile players come in and out of the Andy Reid, Bob Sutton system, one trend has stayed true over this long stretch of winning.\nWhen the Chiefs force turnovers, they win the game.\nSince 2013, KC is 26-4 in games where they win the turnover battle. They are 12-2 when scoring a defensive touchdown and have seven pick-sixes since 2015, the most in the NFL.\nSunday\u2019s 20-17 victory over Carolina showed once again how important turnovers are to KC\u2019s success.\nSafety Eric Berry\u2019s interception returned back for a touchdown brought Kansas City within a score, then Marcus Peters\u2019 forced fumble in the final minute set up the game winning field goal.\nWithout these turnovers, Kansas City stood no chance. The offense only totaled 165 passing yards, failed to score a touchdown all game and couldn\u2019t stay on the field going a lousy 2-12 on third down.\nEven with the lackluster offensive performance, Kansas City won a game without ever leading until the closing seconds. This marks the 14th time in their last 28 regular season games where the outcome has been decided within one score.\nThe Chiefs lead the league in turnovers at 22, four more than any other team, and hold the best turnover differential at plus 14. Sutton\u2019s unit tends to have a knack for forcing these turnovers in the second half.\nKC entered Sunday\u2019s game allowing just 54 points in the second half of games this year and packed on to that with a second half shutout in Carolina. These late game adjustments keep the Chiefs in almost all their games, no matter the deficit.\nTaking a page out of the Kansas City Royals comeback book, the Chiefs have as many wins this season when trailing by 17 or more, two, as the rest of the NFL combined.\nThe never say die approach makes the Chiefs so dangerous, as just like in Carolina, things can unravel very quickly.\nA 17-3 lead into the fourth quarter looked to be almost a sure fire win for the Panthers, since the Chiefs offense struggled to extend drives or push the ball downfield all game. Still, the fire was lit for the Chief front seven as Dee Ford and Chris Jones combined for critical back to back sacks late in the third quarter.\nThe pair of sacks stalled a 10 minute, 20 play drive and knocked the Panthers out of field goal range, which would have extended their lead to three scores. It was the NFL\u2019s longest play drive since 1998 that ended with a punt.\nThis didn\u2019t lead to an offensive touchdown, but it sparked the defense with confidence as they finally brought consistent pressure the quarterback\u2019s way. That proved to be key in the fourth when Cam Newton heaved a pressured pass Eric Berry\u2019s direction, which ended with Berry in the end zone after an impressive 42-yard return.\nWhile Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith played one of his most inaccurate games as a Chief, KC fans saw the pros and cons of having a risky quarterback on Sunday. Newton made a number of great throws that Smith likely doesn\u2019t, but his interception that brought the Chiefs back is a throw Smith likely never attempts.\nThe majority of teams in the NFL need quarterbacks who can push the ball downfield quickly, go through multiple reads and fire passes through a tight window, but the demands for the Chiefs quarterback might be different.\nAs long as the Chiefs are forcing turnovers at a league best rate, and Smith continues to avoid the back-breaking turnover late in games, then the Chiefs might have a winning formula.\nThey aren\u2019t the 1985 Bears on defense, but the ability to consistently force turnovers when the team needs them the most is a quality few can replicate. Peters was burned a couple times in the game as Newton did test him often, but just as he does almost every week, he made up for it with a big turnover.\nThe full Marcus Peters experience is always on the table, as in back to back weeks the Pro Bowl corner has punted the ball in the stands in celebration.\nPeters now has two forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two defensive touchdowns and 13 interceptions in his 25 career games. He is establishing himself as one of the game\u2019s biggest playmakers and the Chiefs can live with a few missed routes or celebratory antics if he and the team continue to produce at a high level.\nThe Chiefs will look to keep the momentum rolling back into Arrowhead next week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with kickoff is set for noon.",

    "context": "Gasoline prices should be at least 50 cents a gallon cheaper than they are today \u2014 and I can prove it.\nOil prices have collapsed over the past few months. And gasoline prices have also fallen.\nGas, in fact, has dropped enough already to make the US Energy Information Administration, which is part of our Department of Energy, predict that prices for this summer will be the lowest in years.\nThat\u2019s all great. But have gasoline prices fallen enough in relation to the drop in crude oil, from which gasoline is made? Or are refiners and oil companies keeping prices higher than they should be?\nLet\u2019s do some comparison shopping to see whether gasoline, which was averaging $2.89 a gallon for regular unleaded last week at the pump, has fallen enough.\nWe are going to look at both the retail price of gas, which includes taxes, and the wholesale price, which doesn\u2019t.\nAs of last week, West Texas Intermediate oil \u2014 a common gauge for the US market \u2014 had fallen to $51.68 a barrel. That\u2019s slightly higher than the futures price, but let\u2019s use it anyway.\nFor the record, WTI oil had been as high as $102 a barrel around this time last year when the financial markets were still pretending that the US and world economies were on some kind of rebound.\nEven as recently as May, WTI oil was at $60 a barrel.\nBut last week oil was down to $51.68 a barrel. And the price of gasoline at wholesale was $1.86 a gallon. The current price at the pump \u2014 the retail price including taxes \u2014 is averaging around $2.89 a gallon.\nThose will be our comparisons. Our baseline.\nSo what was the whole price of gasoline the last couple of times oil was around this level? Back in November 2008, WTI oil was $52.26 a barrel \u2014 higher than it is today \u2014 and the wholesale price of gasoline was just $1.16 a gallon. The retail price was just $2.13 a gallon.\nIn other words, gasoline prices were 70 cents a gallon cheaper at wholesale and 76 cents cheaper at the pump when oil was priced at this level in 2008.\nMaybe that was just a fluke. Let\u2019s look at another time.\nIn January, 2007, oil was selling at $51.51 a barrel. Gasoline was going for $1.34 a gallon wholesale and $2.28 a gallon at the pump. The wholesale price of gas was, in other words, 52 cents a gallon cheaper in 2007 and the retail price of gas was 61 cents a gallon cheaper.\nWhat\u2019s my point? Gasoline prices are much too high right now considering the big decline in crude oil.\nAnd drivers are getting screwed. Congress should look into it.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee did nothing with interest rates for the 53rd straight meeting Wednesday and it hasn\u2019t indicated when it will.\nAs I\u2019ve been saying, the Fed needs to raise rates, wants to raise rates but can\u2019t raise rates. It is stuck/screwed/puzzled/lost/clueless.\nBut there was something important in Wednesday\u2019s FOMC communique \u2014 Fed head Janet Yellen and her colleagues think there have been \u201csolid gains\u201d in the labor market.\nI\u2019ll say it again \u2014 the gains in employment have been statistical flukes and those positive anomalies will end soon.\nLet\u2019s see what the Fed thinks about job growth when the July figures come out next week.\n3M, McDonalds and Visa were the latest companies in the Dow Jones industrial average to benefit from sizable drops in their tax rates.\nLast Thursday I explained how corporate profits aren\u2019t always what they seem, especially when tax rates change dramatically. Up to that point 16 of the 30 Dow stocks had reported earnings and Intel, IBM, JPMorgan Chase and Nike were the biggest beneficiaries of drops in their tax rates.\nI\u2019ve asked David Aurelio, research analyst at Thomson Reuters, to continue to track the remaining Dow stocks and here\u2019s what he found.\nIf McDonald\u2019s tax rate hadn\u2019t declined to 29.8 percent from the 33 percent rate it paid in the second quarter of 2015, the company\u2019s recent earnings would have been only $1.15 billion and not the already disappointing $1.2 billion it reported.\n3M\u2019s profits would have only been $1.28 billion and not $1.3 billion if its tax rate hadn\u2019t fallen from 29.5 percent to 28.1 percent. And Visa, the credit card company, would have earned only $1.45 billion and not the $1.7 billion it reported if its tax rate hadn\u2019t fallen from 33 percent to 21.7 percent.\nI\u2019m sure all of these lower tax rates were achieved legitimately. But this goes to show that a quick glance at earnings won\u2019t tell the whole story.\nA research report by Purdue University says that raising wages to $15 an hour at restaurants will raise prices by 4.3 percent.\nRaising wages to $22 an hour would increase prices by 25 percent. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. (By the way, if wages are ever raised to $22 an hour I\u2019ll be the one asking what kind of sauce you\u2019d like with your nuggets.)\nGiving health benefits to those workers, Purdue\u2019s School of Hospitality and Tourism Management says, would have little effect because of government tax breaks.",

    "context": "Sime Vrsaljko 8/10, Fernando Torres 7/10 in Atletico Madrid win\nAtletico Madrid ground out yet another 1-0 victory at home to Alaves on Saturday night to quietly move into second place in La Liga.\nIn what at best can be described as a dull first half, neither side played much football with the bitterly cold temperatures in the Spanish capital not helping things on -- or off, with the fans doing their best not to freeze -- the pitch.\nYet Atleti, as they so often do, found a way. Alaves were resilient, but substitute Fernando Torres netted his first La Liga goal of the season to secure all three points and leave nobody in doubt that Los Rojiblancos want to be Barcelona's main challengers for the title this year.\nPositives\nUnbeaten in the league, El Nino back in the goals and Sime Vrsaljko looking like a player again.\nNegatives\nTo describe the match as extremely dull is being kind, however the ultra-defensive Alaves have to take their fair share of the blame for that.\nManager rating out of 10\n7 -- Diego Simeone's starting XI was not what was needed against such a deep low-block defence, but his substitutions made all the difference.\nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating)\nGK Jan Oblak, 6 -- You worry he might have caught a cold standing around in the cold doing nothing.\nDF Sime Vrsaljko, 8 -- Where has this been? Showedl the kind of energy, directness and intent that saw him displace Juanfran last season. Wonderful cross for the goal capped his display. Hopefully it is a sign of things to come, as opposed to putting himself in the shop window.\nDF Stefan Savic, 6 -- Looked as if he might have his work cut out with Alaves's nippy duo up front preferring to play with the ball at their feet but after the opening exchanges hds little to do. Did what was required.\nDF Diego Godin, 7 -- Did well to snuff out an early chance for the visitors and that was about as much hard work as he had to do in defence. Could -- probably should -- have scored from a first-half header.\nDF Filipe Luis, 6 -- Attacked well however the final ball was a bit lacking. Might have got a penalty on another day after being caught late in the box.\nMF Koke, 6 -- Forced a neat save with a rare shot at goal in the first period. Grew into it more after the break as Los Colchoneros pressed forwards.\nMF Gabi, 7 -- Neat and tidy, as he always is. Recycles the ball so well and it was he who started the move that ended in the goal. Put in a couple of tasty free kicks from wide areas.\nMF Saul Niguez, 5 -- Not his best day at the office. Should have scored in the first half but dallied a split second too long and his effort was blocked. Hooked with just over 20 minutes to go and the man who replaced him scored the winner.\nMF Thomas Partey, 5 -- Hopeless in possession, resulting in his unceremonious hooking at the break. Looks tired after becoming a fixture in the team this season and could do with a rest.\nFW Antoine Griezmann, 7 -- Was always trying to make something happen and linked well with those around him. Looks a different player to the sulking figure of six weeks ago.\nFW Kevin Gameiro, 5 -- Alaves was never going to give a striker who likes to play on the shoulder of the last defender the kind of room to do them damage. Unfortunately for Gameiro, when he does not have that kind of room he brings very little to the party.\nSubstitutes\nAngel Correa, 7 -- Should have started. Was direct and his quick feet and low centre of gravity are what is needed against such defensive opponents. Involved in build up for the goal, too.\nFernando Torres, 7 -- With his side looking devoid of ideas, he picked a great time to pop up with his first league effort of the season. Has looked in decent form of late and is pushing for a start next time out.\nYannick Carrasco, 7 -- A lively cameo. Another who against this kind of opponent should probably be starting..",

    "context": ">>.\n\u2014\u2014\nI was looking through my drafts and stumbled upon this post. I made it August 10, 2011, and then put it aside to post at a later date.\nAnyway, just felt that now would be the right time to post this.\nMiss you Oscar. Love you tons.\nSo a few weeks back (on August 3, to be exact), I wrote about how I had run a mere 7 miles and was upset because the half marathon in Providence was just a few weeks away. That Sunday, I got a puppy, and then I struggled to CrossFit or run, because I was getting up 3-4 times a night to take my little girl outside. Then the following weekend, I ran a mere 8 miles and struggled, and then felt more nervous than ever about doing the race.\nThe week leading up to the race was great. Maeby (my lovely little pup; good for you if you know the show from which I stole this name) was only getting up once a night and I CrossFitted (yes, it\u2019s a verb) four times that week, and took a couple of rest days before the race since my left knee was bothering me.\nSo, any doubts I had about doing the race, I put aside. The turning point for these doubts actually took place at CrossFit, when one of the guys there told me (as we passed each other during the second mile we had to run for that WOD), \u201cYou are so doing that half marathon.\u201d He made me feel like I could and should do it, and that encouragement was just what I needed.\nAnyway, rambling aside\u2026the race went well. Surprisingly well.\nOne of my goals was to get a PR for the course. I knew getting a PR and thus getting sub-2:00 (still in shock over this) wasn\u2019t going to happen, but I thought maybe I\u2019d do better than last year.\nMy ultimate goal, however, was a bit more daunting for me. I\u2019m super competitive and especially tough on myself. When I struggled in Cheshire back in April, I beat myself up over it for weeks. I knew I could do better and the whole race seemed to drag on and was absolutely miserable. I might\u2019ve PRed that race but it didn\u2019t really matter because I felt crappy the whole time.\nIn Providence, I started off feeling good, but the hills took a toll on me and I began fatiguing fairly early on. I actually forgot how difficult this course was compared to some of the other races I\u2019ve done; by no means is it awful but there are definitely some hills (especially that last one at the end, just before you get to the finish line\u2026so hard!). When I think about it, there\u2019s no way that I would\u2019ve been able to get sub-2:00 in Brooklyn if the course was like this one; no matter how good I felt that day, this course was far more difficult. I had to walk some parts (and for the first time ever, didn\u2019t beat myself up for it) and there was actually a point where I was enjoying myself so much I thought about just walking the rest of the course (which I obviously didn\u2019t, because again\u2026I\u2019m too competitive). Anyway, the end result was as follows:\nNo PR and I walked more than I have in any other half (and more than I should have because honestly, I probably could\u2019ve run the entire thing, maybe minus those hills). But for the first time ever, I didn\u2019t stress about my time, I didn\u2019t even care. I actually enjoyed the race for what it was.\nAnd you know what else? Considering all the walking I did, and the fact that I didn\u2019t run further than 8 miles leading up to the race, I am so happy with my time and with the experience. No stress, I just enjoyed it. And I didn\u2019t feel sad or disappointed or like quitting at any time..and I definitely could\u2019ve finished faster but I. Didn\u2019t. Care.\nMy mentality was entirely different and thus the experience was entirely different.\nSo in the end\u2026\nMy time was about 17 minutes slower than Brooklyn just two months ago (eek), but I finished just over two minutes slower than last year, in 2:14:30. And I\u2019m okay with it. In fact, I\u2019m happy with my time.\nIn retrospect, I kind of wish I had trained more, but I wasn\u2019t sore the next day (and I attribute a lot of that to my increased strength from CrossFit), and I think this race was really important for me to do because I learned to enjoy the experience and not just make it about PRing or anything like that. With the exception of Brooklyn, this was the first race in which I actually felt good about myself the entire time and didn\u2019t beat myself up about my time or pace even once.\nSo, while I might\u2019ve been having a lot of doubts as to whether or not I was going to do this race, the extra push from friends and family (and then from myself) really made me reconsider how to approach this race, and I am so, so happy I did. It also brought back the feelings that I kind of forgot about\u2013the feelings associated with long runs and crossing the finish line and running with a bunch of other people.\nAnd so, don\u2019t quote me on this (because again, I\u2019ve been super busy and exhausted and things are only going to get busier), but I think I may do another half in September and possibly October. The running bug might be back.\ntl;dr: I\u2019ve been busy and didn\u2019t feel like running the Rock \u2018n Roll Providence Half Marathon. But, I ran it anyway, had a great time, and didn\u2019t even do that bad. I think I may have caught the running bug again.\nI wanted to do 8-10.\nVery disappointing.\nBut. On the bright side\u2026\nIt\u2019s Friday, which means it\u2019s only two days until I get my puppy.\nSo a happy Friday it is.\nAnd maybe I\u2019ll try to bang out three more miles during lunch? I really need to get some miles in\u2026",

    "context": "To all the concerned activists of Green Girl world\nYesterday I was sent an email from an old friend. The email was nearly frantic about a new bill being introduced into the legislature. Although I was in that moment seriously disturbed, I also felt compelled to do more research. I have my organizations I hold with great respect, and the initial source for this information was not one of them.\nPhoto by: Modest & Jill\nI am a huge advocate of taking action. I say let\u2019s get political, make calls, and speak up! However, we cannot be alarmists. I\u2019ve definitely been one before and I felt like an idiot. Don\u2019t be that person; it\u2019s not fun. So, we just need to check our sources or do a cross check especially when something doesn\u2019t feel right. Before making a decision on your action. Let\u2019s not become an ignorant mob when people decide to play on our fears (which is what a lot of internet hype is doing right now). On this particular issue I personally feel more disarmed after doing some research.\nSo what was all the concern over? It was in reference to HR 875 a bill called the Food Safety Modernization Act. It seems the bill was introduced by the Democratic Senator of Connecticut, Rosa DeLauro, and not written by Monsanto as the hysteria on the internet is suggesting. The concern was that this could put small organic farmers out of business and the \"food police\" could come arrest you for an organic garden in your backyard. As I had mentioned before, when I first got the email I felt outraged immediately but I had a weird feeling about it since this just seemed too outrageous and very strange that I had not heard anything from what I consider credible sources.\nThere is a consumer group called Food and Water Watch. I actively participate in signing their petitions and I found it odd that they did not send out a warning to me. If they felt it had interests of Agribusiness in mind, they would send out a warning. I also feel that RAN (the Rainforest Action Network) would have sent something out as well since they are active in all issues pertaining to gross corporate power and I have received petitions by them in regards to the giants of Agribusiness.\n- Food and Water watch has created a fact sheet that is available on their site\n- You can also read the opinion of FactCheck.org\n- To read the bill you can go to GovTrack\nI will be the first to say that I would not put anything past big Agribusiness to be pulling shenanigans, however, I feel there are organizations devoted to being our watchdog. Food and Water Watch dedicates their entire day to making sure we know what is going on behind the scenes on the food and water safety fronts, and they have not red flagged this legislation. If they had, I would have received an email from them calling upon their e-newsletter troops to sign a petition. I would still encourage people to call their Senators to voice their opinions or try to get more information, however, I am feeling today that this could be helpful legislation but like many things may need some more tweaking.\nBefore making decisions in general, I would recommend taking a moment for some deep breathing, calming yourself down, centering yourself for maybe a short meditation. When you are done, take another minute to let the feeling of peace around you linger a moment longer so you can appreciate it. Allocate some time to do some background work on whatever important issue you want to make a decision on while attempting to maintain your peace and not let stress and worry creep back in. Start to think from this centered place and realize we have the ability to change things in our life if only we speak up and act.\nTo be a responsible greenie we do have to realize that we need to be active, we need to be political. We should be thankful that we are in a country are allowed an opinion on public matters in the first place. It's a great privilege to be able to vote and we should see taking a stand on issues by petitions or by voting not as a burden but as an honor to protect our beautiful world.\nLearn more about Janine at Green Wave Enterprises",

I\u2019m not sure how long it took me to run my 4 around Sunnyside, but I know it took me at least 42 minutes, if not longer. I thought I hit \u201cStart\u201d on my watch, but was foiled again by my usual pre-dawn befuddlement. Somewhere around mile 3.5, I had to stop, bend over with my hands on my knees, and hock up a perfect, little yellow loogie. One of the mementos left over from my coughing illness last week. I wish I could have expectorated this loogie at, say, the half-mile mark, since once it was no longer rattling around in my chest, I breathed a whole lot easier.\nThen, this evening I hit the road for another 4-miler at 9PM, same route, since it\u2019s cooler with the sun down. This time, I got lucky, and the little yellow loogie of the day made his break for freedom after I\u2019d been running only 5 minutes.

In this weather, you\u2019ll neither breathe easily nor run swiftly anyway. Good for you for running while hocking up loogies, though.\nYou are my hero.

(Never mind it's not what the weekend is about, but we'll get to that in another post, on Monday)\nEven in the face of this newly rediscovered annual freedom festival, there were always a few unlucky or foolish souls who made piss poor decisions that cost them their lives. I knew of a few people in my younger days that fit this bill. Just I am sure others know of some more recently.\nIn the grand scope of things, let's just say there will always be those select few who will feel invincible. This song called, Then Came The Last Days Of May tells the story of three such folly-laden young men:\nInvincibility is overrated, immortality in this world is non-existent. The graveyards hold many who miscalculated and the world has many among us today, who skated a visit from the Grim Reaper.\nIf nothing else we can use both kinds of people as examples, bad and good. The rock world is no exception and is full of late musicians and singers who failed to recognize the folly of walking a tight rope without a balance beam.\nI sense that Morrison might have sensed his own mortality in this all-time classic:\nBe careful out there this weekend. Be Safe.\nRelax and celebrate with passion. But please do it responsibly.\n2 comments:\nI'm so naive I never thought of the meaning of RIDERS ON THE STORM as you've portrayed it but I see your point. While living in Paris, there were two graves I knew I particularly wanted to see...Chopin and Morrison. Morrison's been very badly vandalized (I guess it's more about wanting a piece of him than wanting the grave site to look bad)..Chopin ALWAYS has fresh flowers people still bring..\nthat has to be one of the best intros of any song...always wonderful keyboard from the DOORS..LIGHT MY FIRE's is dynamite, isn't it? In my band, I had to play that and I always felt deficient, though I usually got the notes.\nMemorial Day isn't only about soldiers, is it......memories are memories and too many kids in our memories lost their lives to drugs...\nThanks, LA.\n//that has to be one of the best intros of any song...always wonderful keyboard from the DOORS..LIGHT MY FIRE's is dynamite, isn't it?//\nAs a fan of music, I have always thought so too. It's nice to hear someone in the business validate what I have always felt to be true.\nThe song always had an eerie feel to it, probably because I first heard it after his death. But I will say that if anyone had the opportunity and ability to fake his own death, it would have been him.",

    "context": "True comprehension of the essence of Hashem is impossible. All we can reliably speak about is the way in which Hashem manifests and acts within our perception of reality. The essence of the Divine remains completely and totally hidden from the human mind.\nDespite this fact, we do possess a unique window into the Infinite. Our soul, that which gives us life, is in its essence, co-identical with Hashem. Just as a rock hewn from a mountain remains the exact same substance only separated by physical distance - so too, our soul is a piece of the Divine essence hewn and cut from the whole by the axe of material manifestation.\nBeing-in-this-world is that which cuts us away from our source, leaving our soul stranded from its ultimate source. Thus, our soul remains our primary portal to the Divine. Engaging with and wrestling with the Divine within our individual self is our best route to accessing that which includes all things.\nAt its root, our soul possesses the same essential quality as the Divine: the unbounded and insatiable will to give. Hashem is that which only gives, and never takes. Hashem gives life and meaning to the entirety of reality - for it is from Hashem which reality has been emanated. The posture of giving, of creating, of emanating from oneself entire worlds, is also present in our souls, albeit only in potential.\nThe fact of material existence erects a barrier between our souls and the Source to which they strive to return. Our world acts as a ever-densening shield, blocking more and more of the light which tries to shine through time and space into our soul\u2019s potential. That potential remains unrealized so long as we resist the effort to adopt Hashem\u2019s will to give, for our materiality engraves upon us an irrevocable will to receive.\nBeing a creature and not the Creator means that we exist through the will to receive. We receive our life, our breath, our food, our soul, our heartbeat, our mind - all through the will to give of the Infinite. Hashem gives, and we take. That is the basic nature of humanity - to be ever-taking in embracing the will to receive. Yet, if we wish to clear away the screens which block our souls, to reveal the occluded light of our own deepest selves, we must make ourselves anew in the image of Hashem. We do this by actualizing the potential of the will to give which is embedded in our very essence.\nReceiving is unavoidable, for it is the basic prerequisite for existence. However, what we do with what is received is a choice left entirely to us. If we want to make our potential will to give manifest, we must transmutate ourselves and our will to receive, transforming ourselves into something more akin to Hashem, giving. We cannot stop taking, but we can ensure that we take only in order to give.\nLike the Sun, Hashem\u2019s light is always shining. When it is cloudy, it is shining (even if hidden from our eyes). When it is night, it is shining (even if we are not in the location to see it). The light of Hashem is omnipresent and always available to those who are able to see it. It gives, and takes from no thing. Just as the entire solar system depends on its giving its light, so too all of reality depends on the light of Hashem. The rays of the Sun shine equally upon all, making no distinctions between the righteous and the wicked, the human and the animal, or the Jew and the Gentile.\nWe, meanwhile, are built as solar panels - specially designed to catch the light of the Sun. The soul of a human being is more efficient and more capable of absorbing that Holy Light than anything else, for it was designed for that purpose. It\u2019s primary function is to receive, it operates totally under the auspices of the will to receive. Yet, what use is a solar panel unconnected to some grid?\nWe mustn't be the solar panel that simply soaks up the Divine Light and lets it fill our fuel cells. We will burn out, becoming indifferent to the beautiful sight of the Sun\u2019s rays. Rather, we need to mirror our beneficiary, using the light we\u2019re able to absorb to power others; passing on the energy invested in us by giving it to others. We must make our souls like perfectly efficient solar panels: absorbing just enough Light to redistribute, creating a perfectly neutral conduit for the Divine design.\nHow then, do we accomplish this feat? How do we turn our will to receive into one to give? How we use the Light which shines within us to empower others? It may seem as though we would need some kind of manual for how to do this - and in fact, we do, and it has already been provided to us. The Tora, and the system of mitzvot is the means by which we transform our souls back to their Divine design.\nA life lived according to the principles of halakha can act as an antidote to the natural-born selfishness of material creatures. It can also be co-opted to only further reinforce that selfishness. How do we distinguish? Ultimately, we must consider what the purpose of the system of halakha is and what benefit it has to offer us.\nHalakha is not \u2018Jewish Law.\u2019 There are certainly elements of it which include those things that we may justifiably label as \u2018legal.\u2019 Yet, it itself is something entirely other than a criminal or civil legislative code. Halakha is a path, as its name suggests, one that we walk on in order to reach a certain destination. Halakha is not, and can never be, the end of a religious life. The purpose of a religious life is not to act out the system of halakha. Rather, halakha is the route in which we take to achieve a truly religious life, one in which we engage with the necessary project of redeeming ourselves from the will to receive and inculcating within ourselves the will to give.\nHalakha is the means, not the end; and its purpose is to refine us, to prepare us, to help purify us of the will to receive and enable us to undertake the tremendous work of self-transformation.",

    "context": "Have you heard of the match-three genre? Of course you have. A conservative count puts the number of match three games in the app store at above fifty. As in the other games, with a grid of different pieces in Friki Tricks, you need to move items around to match three of the same icons in a row. This causes those pieces to disappear, and new ones to fall into the playing field. But will there be enough in Friki Tricks to hold your interest in this saturated genre?\nLikes\nArt style: The presentation in this game is solid. Right from the intro as the title sequence changes from black and white to colour, the art style impressed me. Characters in the game are unique and colourful, with a cartoonish look. The game pieces and art in between levels are also impressive and makes it really feel like a quality title.\nBonuses: Besides the usual playing and progressing to the next level, the matching gameplay is broken up by a spinning wheel between levels. While there\u2019s not much to do but hit to stop it from spinning and collect your prize, you can get yourself quite a few different bonuses to mix up the gameplay. It was a nice break from the matching game and I found myself looking forwards to it and the end of each level.\nDislikes\nNot challenging: I didn\u2019t find the gameplay particularly engaging. For one, this was because the genre of match three is overdone. But I also found it to be a bit too easy. Matches were always obvious and quick to do. I\u2019d get stuck the odd time, but then by dropping a bomb it returned to being easy right away again.\nWhile there was nothing innovative about the game itself, I thought the art style was unique and interesting. I always looked forward to the bonuses between rounds, and the easy gameplay made it ideal to pull out for quick rounds. If you haven\u2019t tired of the genre, give Friki Tricks a try.\nFriki Tricks was developed by W3 Software and is available for the introductory price of $0.99, with a price raise to $2.99 later on. I played version 1.0 on an iPod Touch 2G, going through each game mode multiple times, in different sessions. There\u2019s also a free lite version available. This review was written with the current price point of $0.99 in mind.\n2 thoughts on \u201cFriki Tricks Review: More Match Three!\u201d\nMy favorite game on Iphone\ngreat, fun, \u2026\nYou have to try it !!",

    "context": "My daughter and her friends: Are they laughing at you?*\n*Nota bene\nToday, 5 months after starting the process, I got the call that JC, the main man of neurology at my hospital, signed my Tysabri order. Which, apparently, means that tomorrow the infusion center will call me to schedule the first infusion. I have to get it scheduled before August 31, or else go back and do another series of MRIs of the brain and spine. I'd definitely prefer not to, since the stuff they put into the IV (I can't remember the name of it) makes me go loco. Seriously. I have a weird reaction to it. Gadolinium, I think it is.\nI'm trying not to be whiney and complainy about my medical procedures. I don't do a very good job, though. My last MRI - a couple of months ago, turned out to be disturbing. They measure MS in terms of degrees of 'brain damage'. Basically, three categories - small, medium and large. Those aren't the actual words, but you get the drift. When I went to have the films reviewed, she said I was at the 'medium' level, which was new, and showed me a section on my corpus callosum which was also new. She showed me these lesions that looked like fingers - like a big, white, hand forming around that part of the brain. She said \"this is a classic set of MS lesions\", and that that particular area is where you'd see cognitive functionality being affected (one of my particular losses).\nLater, when I went in to work, I was telling some friends about the big, white hand and we started referring to it as the \"White People in My Brain\". I've got white people in my brain!!! \"Um, the white people in my brain are stopping me from understanding this Venn diagram...'\nAnother reason I dropped out of western medicine was because of things like this. Is it really helpful to know this? I really don't know. I wonder if, when it comes to damaging lesions in the brain, that ignorance might be bliss. I figure, you are going to experience whatever the damage is regardless of whether you saw it ahead of time.\nThe Tysabri news felt a bit bittersweet, because fellow MS'er Courtney had a bad reaction to her 2nd infusion yesterday, which was pretty heartbreaking for her. They say if you have an allergy, or sensitivity to it, it will most likely show on the 2nd one. Given the fear about PML, I've read they don't allow you to continue with the infusions after that. But that could be changing. There are been no new PML deaths since it went back on the market 14 months ago. Like me, Courtney seems to be a side effect magnet with the MS drugs. If we take it, they will come.\nSo, yesterday, I had the big mammo grammo. I don't know how long it has been since I had one. (My friend Paul said \"let's see, when did St. Elmo's Fire come out?\" Which just made me laugh like crazy.)\nI had my reasons. The last time I had one, they sent me in for surgery to have a tumor removed. Benign, as it turned out. It was a very unpleasant procedure that I felt I shouldn't have had to do to begin with. I should have had the balls to ask them to do a needle biopsy first, but at that time I wasn't aggressive enough to do that. I tend to get intimidated by the white coats and lose my sense of self. Now, when I have an important appointment that might require decisions, I bring my friend Scotti. Scotti is awesome - she survived metastasized malignant melanoma, and she's a great procedure buddy. She was by my side during my period of really awful miscarriages, one of which was an emergency room surgical thing with massive blood loss. But I dropped out of western medicine world for a while there because, I think, I was tired of the drama.\nI think it was about 14 years ago. So I was due. I'll pass on all the details of the mammo grammo (which Adam Sandler character says things like that? Opera man? Or the Louisiana guy? I started saying it because it made me laugh and thus feel less anxious.) Though I will say, the technician told me I looked like I was scared to death. Which I was. It was my first one since my 'enhancements' and I just could not imagine how this was going to happen.\nIt actually went remarkably well. Much less pain than the last time. It's funny - I have no reason to think that there are any other tumors or anything, but until they send me the \"prognosis negative\" letter, there's that period of waiting that tends to get on my nerves. Much like the Tysabri. I realized today, when I got the call, that I had had this undercurrent of \"waiting anxiety\" happening for several months.\nI am just not that good with the waiting thing. However, in the last year of diagnosing Adrian's dyslexia, finding the right school for him, living through Dagny's 7th grade, having my job change, and trying to get the Tysabri thing in place, I have done a lot of it. And here I am, with many of those things resolved or at least having 'resolution potential'. I have taken most of these things quite literally one step at a time. I would often not know what the next step would be until I finished the current step. It's been a good lesson in that tortoise-and-the-hare kind of stuff.\nNext up: 3rd grade, 8th grade, life on Tysabri? Here I come.\nI've gotta get some sleep - I think the white people are moving furniture around up there.",

But I shook myself out of it, and I decided it probably is a good idea that we don\u2019t Skype or call every week... because it\u2019s THAT nice! I agree though this last time really was a blessing, talk with grandparents, see and talk with you all, and most of all see my new nephew, WOW! Perfect timing buddy.\nWow, I also got a little emotional reading about the priesthood blessings the bishopric gave you guys. As a missionary we are promised that our families will be greatly blessed with spiritual blessings while we are not there. I fully believe that this experience honestly was one of those manifestations. I am really grateful for our inspired church leadership and priesthood that God uses to express His love to His saints. This only can be done in His true church as well.\nAwesome. Well I guess I should probably fill you guys in on my last little week. Well, big news. We got the news on HOW the Mission will be split, and we will know WHO will be split next week with transfers. Sounds like Juazeiro will be a part of a whole different mission, \"Natal\". Ha, so there is a 1% chance that I will go to another big city of Brazil. But we\u2019ll see. The conference was very good and I loved to hear the President and his Wife really express their love for us. I also was able to talk and converse with just about all my good friends from the mission.\nFor the work, we baptized a man named Cristovam. He is a 60-year-old man. He was an alcoholic a month ago, but the moment our Ward Mission Leader told him about the church, he stopped. He is a very humble big ol\u2019 Eyore (from Pooh Bear) type guy. It was very heart warming to see him draw very close to his Heavenly Father. Like what Elder McLaws said after he interviewed him, you can FEEL that the Atonement is really working in his life.\nLove you all, BYE\n-Elder Zac Cetraro",

The Northwestern Wildcats routes the North Carolina Tar Heels 21-7 to capture their 5th consecutive National Championship at Johnny Unitas Stadium on May 24, 2009. Yuchen Nie/DC Sports Box\nTOWSON, MD--Before the season even started, Hannah Nielsen, Northwestern\u2019s star senior midfielder, joked with her teammates that the only thing that these seniors haven\u2019t done in their star-studded career was to go undefeated. During the season though, the idea that they would go undefeated stayed strong with the team despite facing major obstacles, one of which included attack/midfielder Hilary Bowen tearing her ACL a little over a month ago. Rather than calling it quits for the rest of the season, Bowen, one of the best finishers in the country, wrapped her knee with bandages and a custom brace for every game and finished with five goals in the championship game.\nIn the semi-final game against Penn, the Wildcats struggled with shooting the ball and allowed the Penn Quakers to come back and tie it before the end of regulation. Then, if it were not for Katrina Dowd\u2019s behind-the-back goal with less than a second remaining, the Wildcats may have never had a chance to reach the finals. This game however, the Wildcats focused on taking quality shots and implementing their full-field pressure defense.\nNorthwestern got off to a quick start by scoring two goals from Hilary Bowen and Mary Kate Casey to go up 2-0 in under three minutes. Then after four minutes of play, Megan Bosica drew a penalty within the 8-meter for a free-position shot. Bosica converted only to have Danielle Spencer slash through the Carolina defense minutes later to put Northwestern up by two goals.\nOn the ensuing draw, Danielle Spencer used their height advantage to snatch the ball out of the air and quickly dished it to Brooke Matthews, who is the fastest person on Northwestern\u2019s squad. Matthews took less than 12 seconds to run from midfield to the opposing goal and fired a shot past Carolina goalie Logan Ripely to put the Wildcats up three. However, on the next possession, Cory Donohue would score on a free-position shot to cut the lead to two. Just when Carolina seem to have gotten comfortable with their opponent, the Tar Heels suddenly collapsed allowing Northwestern to go on a ridiculous 10-goal run in the last twenty minutes of the first half to put the game away. Carolina had absolutely no response to the onslaught of goals and struggled to even keep their heads up to fight off the frustration.\nDuring this run, most of the goals scored were either done by dodging to the goal or Hannah Nielsen feeding from behind the net to one of their cutters. In fact, Hannah Nielsen would finish with no goals, but an eye-popping six assists as the Northwestern squad lit up the stats sheet. Also, the most impressive fact with the Wildcat\u2019s first half run was that they scored 15 goals on only 17 shots meaning that almost all their shots were at point-blank range right in front of the cage.\nIn the second half, Northwestern continued their dominance by scoring the first four goals including two unassisted goals from Danielle Spencer. Spencer, who is listed at 6-2, used her size and surprising quickness to muscle her way to the cage, and she finished with four goals (all of them were unassisted) and an assist.\nFinally, with the last 15 minutes of the game, Coach Hiller eased the offensive pressure and elected to play a game of keep-away for the remaining minutes under mercy-rule.\nWith this win, Northwestern wins their fifth consecutive national championship making them the second team in history to win five straight, and only two more short of Maryland\u2019s seven-year championship record. Also, Coach Hiller has a winning percentage well above 95% giving her the NCAA record for the highest postseason winning percentage.",

I was someone who, growing up, was heavily under the delusion that everyone else \"gets it\" and \"has it going on\" ; both my husband and I get a real kick out of reminiscing about what life seemed like to us when we were the age we would have been when our parents were at our current age, if that makes sense. Every time, we laugh about how naive we were, and how solidly we assumed that our parents knew everything (or nothing, depending on the age!). They sure fooled us, which we now have the wisdom to realize was a good thing!\nYou are here\nYour 40s: What Do You Learn?\nTurning 40 is a big birthday. The worst thing you can do is give your partner a surprise 40th birthday party! It heralds a new decade that \u201c20 something\u2019s\u201d think of as \u201cgetting old\u201d. I remember when I was growing up in the 60s we talked about \u201cnever trusting anyone over 30\u201d. We were the original wise guys! My 40th birthday was great! I was about to move to this terrific new place, Seattle, and I was starting a new adventure in my life. I finally felt more secure in my profession. I was enjoying my children, who were a little older, and required less heavy lifting. It was a good moment in my life.\nMy fourth decade was exciting and challenging both at work and at home. My kids became teenagers (now that was a wild ride) and I was building this new department at The Everett Clinic. I was blessed with good health and a lot of energy. I was fortunate. Pamela Druckerman ponders her life\u2019s lessons during this decade (What you learn in your 40s, New York Times, February 28, 2014). She notes that researchers view this epoch as the \u201crush hour of life\u201d, where the heights of career and child rearing collide. Today\u2019s \u201cforty something\u2019s\u201d are two careers, two kid couples. It\u2019s a busy time, probably too busy. Balancing career, family, marriage, and self-care is a tightrope walk! One false step and off you go, careening downwards! Below are some of Ms. Druckerman\u2019s, 44 years old, bolded insights about this bell weather decade.\n- There is less worry about what other people think of you.\nThank goodness for that. Life is too short to worry what other people think. It\u2019s far more important to consider what you think about others and the world around you!\n- Eight hours of continuous, un-medicated sleep is like being in heaven.\nSo who gets eight hours of uninterrupted sleep in their 40s? In fact, who gets 8 hours of continuous sleep in their 50s or 60s! Gone are the days of falling asleep before your head hits the pillow, sleeping through the night, and waking up only when the alarm chimes!\n- There are no grown-ups.\nHmm. No one really has it together. We are all winging it at the same time, and no one really knows what they are doing. We are all \u201cfaking it until we make it\u201d.\n- Forgive your exes, even the awful ones. They were just winging it, too.\nEasier said than done Ms. Druckerman, but a very good idea. Maybe our exes will forgive us too.\n- Just say \u201cno\u201d.\nI like this one. All too often, adults think they have to do something that they don\u2019t want to do. Guess what, no one really cares that much! And if they do, that\u2019s their problem.\n- Don\u2019t buy those too-small jeans, on the expectation that you will soon lose weight.\nDon\u2019t you just hate that! About 99% of Americans want to lose 5 lbs. In your 40\u2019s, you\u2019re too busy to get enough exercise and eat salads that you have to make!\n- You are more like other people than you think.\nThe truth\u2014we are far more alike than different. Sure each of us is unique. But a heck of a lot less than we would like to think!\n- You are more like your mother or father than you think.\nNow when I look in the mirror I see a guy that looks like my Dad. I notice that I am a lot more like my Mom than I ever thought. And, I do have some traits that seem to be just my own. But I realize that whomever I resemble, I\u2019m me. So what have you learned or are you learning in your fourth decade?\nI'm not to my 40s yet but I'm already starting to feel those types of things that my mom always told me I would. Realizing what's really important and understanding that most things aren't black and white.\nI have realized I should have been less like my parents earlier and enjoyed myself more in my 20's and 30's. Now I am just trying to break out of the work and home only mode so I can actually have something I enjoy in life! My advice: Play! Play! Play!\nI'm 47, and the comment, \"there are no grown-ups,\" made me laugh. Nearly every day, I think to myself that the grown-up police are going to bust in and haul me off for impersonating an adult. I still feel like a kid, in terms of the uncertainty and lack of confidence, but also in my sense of humor and the way I enjoy things. I think sometimes we confuse being an \"adult\" with being sophisticated. Maybe sophistication is over-rated?

    "context": "Anytime I write an article like this one, there's a high probability that I'll get a few emails from\nguitarists saying that they think lessons are a waste of time and money. They'll then mention some amazing\nplayers that are self-taught. Because of this, let's get something out of the way right now...\nObviously, most people will lie somewhere in between these two extremes. This means that the majority of\nguitarists can reach a certain level by teaching themselves, but will probably benefit from the help of a skilled\nteacher at some point in their development.\nWith that said, I really need to stress here that the point of this article isn't to persuade you to get\nlessons. If you want to go it alone, that's great. And I wish you all the best! But if you have been thinking of\ngetting some guitar lessons, then continue reading...\nBefore you even contact a guitar teacher, you need to think about your musical goals. The reason is that this\nwill often dictate how many lessons you might potentially need. If you have very modest musical goals, such as\nlearning a few campfire songs, then will you need to take a lot of lessons over a period of years? Probably not. On\nthe other hand, if you have very ambitious goals then it's unrealistic to expect any teacher to get you there with\njust a few lessons. You'll probably need ongoing help and support from a teacher over a long period of time.\nThe people who generally succeed the most with teaching themselves are very disciplined practicers. They don't\nneed a teacher to motivate them to practice their asses off. But I've found from teaching MANY people over the\nyears that most people just aren't this disciplined. If left to their own devices they will practice in an\noff-and-on way. In other words, when they start getting busy with work and other obligations, they don't have the\ndiscipline to maintain their guitar practice. They will sometimes have days, or even weeks, where they don't\npractice.\nIt's normal for most guitarists to start practicing way more once they start lessons. They also find it easier\nto maintain their practice knowing that they will be coming for a lesson in a week or two. This fact alone makes\nongoing lessons very valuable. If going to a lesson each week helps you to stay motivated with practice, then that\nalone is worth the cost of lessons!\nMany guitarists have totally unrealistic expectations with regards to lessons. They are expecting the teacher to\nhelp them reach their goals in a ridiculously short period of time. For Example: I've had students start lessons\nwith me who had incredibly ambitious goals, and it was abundantly clear in the first couple of lessons that they\nhad no intention of ever taking ongoing lessons. In other words, they wanted me to perform a miracle.\nIt's also interesting to note that they had been to a lot of teachers before me, and had never stuck with any\nteacher for more than a few lessons. While it's possible that they had incredibly bad luck with choosing terrible\nteachers, I feel it's much more likely that their expectations were just totally ludicrous. They were expecting\nthings from their teachers that just weren't possible.\nIn the world of classical music, it's normal for people to start lessons at a very young age and then get weekly\nlessons for an extremely long period of time. The reason for this is that reaching a high-level of playing\nclassical music is a very long-term goal, and many obstacles need to be overcome along the way. Getting help from a\ngood teacher will almost certainly speed up the process of overcoming these obstacles. For this reason, people\nstarting to learn classical music generally see regular lessons as a necessary investment rather than an\nunnecessary expense.\nI've found in my own teaching, that the people I help most are the ones who commit to a long-term course of\nstudy with me. I can give them ongoing support, advice and guidance as they become more-and-more advanced as\nplayers and musicians.\nI'm not saying that just having a few lessons wouldn't be beneficial.

    "question": "What factors can influence the number of guitar lessons a person might need?",
    "answer": "The number of guitar lessons a person might need can be influenced by their musical goals. If a person has modest musical goals, such as learning a few songs, they might not need many lessons. However, if a person has ambitious goals, they will likely need ongoing help and support from a teacher over a long period of time.",

Mr Qureshi was reinstated in the FIA after the Supreme Court suspended on Friday the notification regarding his transfer to the National Police Foundation. After returning to the office on Saturday, Mr Qureshi wrote a letter to the DG, asking him to restore \u2013 deputy director Javed Shah, assistant directors Muhammad Ahmed and Khalid Anees and inspector Muhammad Sarwar (transferred on Saturday to DI Khan, Turbat, Peshawar and Gawadar, respectively) \u2013 to their previous place of posting (Lahore) as they had assisted him in the NICL scam. The letter says: \u201cThe transfer of the officials in question is tantamount to violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s orders. It shows malafide intention and aims at creating hurdles in the investigation of the scam.\u201d A copy of the letter has also been dispatched to the Supreme Court registrar. There is a word in the agency that these officials have been transferred because they had investigated PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi. However, Q\u2019s information secretary Kamil Ali Agha said to link the transfer of the FIA officials with Moonis was an attempt to \u201cdamage his case legally\u201d. \u201cMoonis has been indicted after a challan submitted in the banking court. Besides, all the witnesses have been testified and an acquittal application has already been filed,\u201d he said. Mr. Agha said the PML-Q also smelt a rat in the move as it seemed \u201csome hidden hands in the government are on the agenda of irritating the judiciary in Moonis\u2019 case to achieve their vested interests.\u201d According to an FIA official, some eight officials were transferred on Saturday. \u201cThere has been no standing direction from the apex court to transfer the officials in question,\u201d he said. After Mr Qureshi\u2019s return to the FIA, a PPP\u2019s federal minister may be in trouble for his alleged share in the scam. According to sources, the minister in question has received Rs200 million in the NICL land deal in Dubai.

    "context": "Let me present a thought experiment. Suppose the twentieth century had gone a different way. Europe is now ruled by a rejuvinated Habsburg Empire. These Austrians are America\u2019s main compeditor for world power. The Habsburgs are aggressively Catholic; they have declared that they will use any means at their disposal, not excluding military force, to rid the world of American-sponsored evils like abortion. Suppose half of academia was Catholic and fairly obvious in their support of the Empire. Suppose crypo-Catholic movies were constantly coming out of Hollywood. Who do you think would be more inclined towards a confrontational posture towards the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the right or the left? Who would be more inclined towards negotiation or even appeasement?\nSometime during the last century, the stereotype of right-wing aggressiveness became quite widespread. On the one hand, conservatives and reactionaries were supposed to be prone to violence, always eager to see war as the solution to every foreign difficulty, and filled with a murderous hatred for other countries. On the other hand, liberals, leftists, and socialists were thought to be pacifists at heart and naive in their inability to see the need for prudent self-defense. Now, it is not true that conservative beliefs logically lead to militarism; nor is it the case that liberalism logically entails pacifism. However, stereotypes don\u2019t come from nowhere, and this one was certainly based on a legitimate observation, regardless of how it was misinterpreted. To understand it properly, we should remember who the main foreign threat was from 1945-1990 for America and the other nations that once constituted Christendom. It was, of course, the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. These countries were seen as threats partly because of their military power, but primarily because they were the bearers of a revolutionary ideology that denied our legitimacy.\nCommunist beliefs were no secret to anybody. All the authoritative structures of the West\u2013the patriarchal family, the Church, the nation-state, private property\u2013were regarded as forms of oppression. They had no right to exist; in fact, it was every communist\u2019s duty to hasten their demise. With the communists, there could be no peace, but only temporary truces, because for them we had no legitimacy. To them, we were like terrorists who have taken an airplane full of hostages. One might negotiate with the terrorists, it\u2019s true, but only because one is forced to. However, one never imagines that the terrorists have any legitimate claim to their hostages, and one sees no obligation to negotiate in good faith when trickery is an option. To the communists, our governments, our employers, our bishops, and our fathers were just a gang of hostage-takers who had managed to abduct entire nations.\nIt may be true, as the paleoconservatives point out, that foreign wars are a threat to American traditions and a spur to big government, so the right should try to be against them. In the face of a revolutionary threat of this sort, though, these worries are academic. Communism was a threat to everything conservatives were committed to defending. And the threat was real. Half of the world had already fallen to these new Jacobins, and they had won the allegiance of our intellectual and entertainment classes. On the other hand, to a liberal, the communists were basically right in their criticism of us. The respectable liberal only objected to the brutal means the communists used\u2013they were trying to go \u201ctoo fast\u201d. On the destination, there was little dissent. Therefore, both sides were partly wrong and partly right, so the hostility between them was tragic and unnecessary. Hence, it made sense that in the Cold War, it would be conservatives who would lean \u201chawkish.\u201d\nWhy, though, were people so quick to generalize and speak about propensities of the \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d in general. As a viewer of 1960\u2019s science fiction, I think I can answer that too. Firstly, all the television and movie makers were rooting for the communists. Second, their audiences most certainly were not. Screenwriters knew that nobody would pay to see a movie about heroic reds defeating reactionaries and capitalist pigs to set up the dictatorship of the proletariat. Still, they wanted to advance the Cause somehow. So they struck up the idea of advancing \u201cpeace\u201d: movie after movie and TV show after TV show would advance the idea that everyone could get along fine if we could just get rid of a few people (inevitably American military men) called \u201chawks\u201d who want to provoke a nuclear war for no reason. By sapping the will of the West to resist while doing nothing against communist morale (after all, these movies weren\u2019t made for them), these peace movies effectively advanced the communist side. As a side effect, they gave us our contemporary stereotypes about rightist hawks and leftist doves.\nFiled under: Conservatism vs Liberalism |\nUnfortunately such left-leaning ideological distortion still seems to be with us! The good news is that their media monopoly is *gone*.\nHello Mr. Long,\nThanks for stopping by. I\u2019d like to take comfort in what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s true that the news media can no longer spin stories with complete impunity. On the other hand, leftist hegemony in the academic and entertainment worlds (where opinions are really shaped) seems to me more complete than ever. Still, I guess those of us \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d should welcome any good news that comes our way.\nHello: this is several years later, but you seem to have been prescient. The \u201cleft\u201d nowadays (not a monolithic term) in American politics seems to lean heavily towards war with various foreign powers, at least as heavily as the \u201cright\u201d. I wonder if at least some of this is due to the alleged \u201cconservatism\u201d of the new Russia. Sorry about all the scare-quotes, but political alliances are shifting so rapidly in America as to make all these terms somewhat doubtful (their usage varies depending on the speaker) .",

    "context": " are (too often) missing.\nThe Walkman provided the first mobile way to have a truly personal listening experience. The combination of a small package, headphones and lightweight cassette tapes allowed people to take their music (and audio) everywhere, and tune out the world around them.\nAnd the recording industry took notice. A wider variety of music became available, and producers of educational materials created more and more audio learning materials (including lectures, \u201cbooks on tape\u201d and more) to feed the hunger of the Walkman.\nWith such a powerful and game changing tool, one would think that all of these factors and innovations would lead to better communication, but 34 years later, one could argue that less true communication is happening than ever. While it isn\u2019t the \u201cfault\u201d of Sony and its Walkman, there are factors that point to tools like it contributing to the demise of communication effectiveness.\nPeople can\u2019t listen if they are somewhere else. I am reminded of this often as I drive with my children (14 and 21) in the back seat of the car. I can talk to them. They are physically there, but communication can\u2019t happen because the ear buds/headphones in their ears mean they are really somewhere else. This of course isn\u2019t a phenomenon of just my kids \u2013 but of our culture. Just because people are in the room, doesn\u2019t mean they are listening; yet often we assume they are. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I told them in the meeting,\u201d is the siren song for passing the communication responsibility off to the listener \u2013 and we know it doesn\u2019t work that way.\nPeople are more distracted \u2013 and less able to focus than ever. Because of the awesome tools at our disposal, we have more things to be distracted by than ever, but this point goes far beyond that. Because we are so used to putting things in our ears to listen to \u2013 we have more trouble than ever focusing when our ears are open. The headphones take us away with the music or message, but without them we are subjected to the cacophony around us, and we are less skilled at focusing on one message at a time.\nJust because it is recorded, doesn\u2019t mean people will listen (or understand). Speakers, trainers and educational providers thought the Walkman was the ticket to increased learning. Then they thought the same with the CD, and the MP3 player. Just because you create the message, doesn\u2019t mean people will hear the message \u2013 even if they buy it, and even if they hit the play button.\nThe audio recording isn\u2019t the full communication anyway. The Walkman gave easy access to audio communication anywhere, yet audio alone limits our ability to communicate. We all know that it is easier to communicate face to face than over the phone \u2013 the spoken word alone doesn\u2019t always communicate our message. The Walkman seduced us to thinking that a recording would do it all for us \u2013 and the remnants of that belief are everywhere.\nOne way communication is limited. This is an obvious statement, and the Walkman wasn\u2019t designed to create two way conversations, yet because it so powerfully and easily impacted one-way communication, we sometimes forgot this (very) important point. Which leads to the next point . . .\nAsynchronous communication is more limited than we realize. We live in a world with so many tools for communication \u2013 many of them that separate the time and space between a message being sent and a message being received. While these tools are very helpful to us in many ways, we often live with the mirage that communication has occurred. Don\u2019t believe me? How often have you said, or heard things like: \u201cI sent them the email\u201d or \u201cEveryone just needs to watch the video we produced\u201d or \u201cI texted them\u201d? Asynchronous, all.\n\u2026.\nWhile this post may seem cynical so far, all of these facts can be turned around individually if not culturally. If you want to be a more effective communicator, read on . . .\nIt all starts with something we all know, but too often, as proven by our actions, we forget.\nTrue communication isn\u2019t (just) about sending a message \u2013 however well prepared and carefully crafted. True communication doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum \u2013 it requires engagement in some way by the receiver. True communication is message sent, and message received.\nThe Walkman gave us a tool for sending and receiving, but we gave it and its electronic cousins too much credit and got lazy in our communication.\nThe best thing you can do as a communicator is focus on getting your message received. Check for understanding more often. Ask more questions. Focus on how you can engage the listener at a deeper level. Make the communication relevant and meaningful to them. Doing those things will make all the difference.\nPut on your iPod (the Walkman\u2019s great granddaughter), listen to some soft music and think about how you can become a more effective communicator. Then take out your ear buds and practice your \u201cmessage received\u201d skills \u2013 because message sent isn\u2019t enough.",
    "question": "What is the impact of the Walkman and similar devices on communication according to the context?",
    "answer": "The Walkman and similar devices have contributed to the decline of effective communication. They have created a culture where people are physically present but mentally elsewhere due to distractions from these devices. They have also led to a misconception that recorded messages are sufficient for communication, ignoring the importance of face-to-face interaction and two-way communication. Despite these devices providing tools for sending and receiving messages, they have made people complacent in their communication efforts.",

He blinked once, brought the other man into focus as he extended his hand between them. \u201cNathan Standeven\u2026\u201d Dillon smiled. \u201cWhat a delight it is to finally meet you.\u201d Dillon looked him over and what he saw caused his cock to throb against his jeans.\n\u201cI do believe the pleasure is mine.\u201d Nathan\u2019s face lit up with joy.\nDillon\u2019s attraction for Nathan took him totally off guard. Ogling the full length of his date\u2019s body, Dillon knew he couldn't hide what he was thinking. Holy shit. He\u2019s hot!\nRight there in front of the movie theater, uncaring of who watched, Nathan cupped Dillon\u2019s jaw settling his mouth over Dillon\u2019s. Dillon welcomed Nathan\u2019s tongue as it slid past his parted lips. Coffee. He tastes like coffee and chocolate.\nDillon groaned into his lover\u2019s mouth. \u201cI need you. Right now.\u201d\nDillon led his boss\u2019s brother to his van, clamoring in a twist of arms and legs to the bench seat in the back. He meshed his rigid cock with Nathan\u2019s as moans filled the van.\nNathan grunted, reached for Dillon\u2019s shirt. \u201cToo many clothes.\u201d\nFueled by desire and the scent of hot flesh, Dillon stripped quickly, his cock throbbing with the mix of cool night air and Nathan sans clothing. When Nathan lifted off the seat to shove his pants down his legs, Dillon gripped his hips and flipped Nathan over. He spread Nathan\u2019s ass cheeks and slathered the alluring manhole with his wet tongue.\nBut only for a minute. Nathan had something else in mind.\n\u201cTurn around here and let me taste that fat cock of yours.\u201d Nathan ordered, pulling away to lay on his back across the seat.\nA final flick over Nathan\u2019s asshole, and Dillon turned around and straddled his lover\u2019s face. Dillon swiped his hard cock across Nathan\u2019s moist lips as he took great pleasure in gulping down the well-endowed prick that danced before him.\nUnable to control himself any longer, Dillon rocked his hips forward. Dillon felt Nathan\u2019s throat tighten around his prick. Sounds of slurping and gagging spurred Dillon\u2019s craving for satisfaction.\nNathan\u2019s ability to deep throat sent Dillon\u2019s eyes rolling back and made him yearn for even more of his date\u2019s cock in his throat.\nGasping for a quick breath of air, Nathan cried out. \u201cFuck my face, baby. Shove that cock!\u201d\nNathan\u2019s fingers dug into Dillon\u2019s ass cheeks. And at the same time, he also received another few inches of dick in his throat.\nWith a final thrust of his cock and plunge of his mouth, Dillon ensured both cocks were buried deep. Muffled moans filled the van as lust washed over the backs of their throats.\nDillon swallowed one last time then turned around. He grinned, loving the sparkle in Nathan\u2019s pretty blue eyes. \u201cThis show is playing tomorrow night too.\u201d\n~The End~",

    "context": "Thank you to Jena Jake for today\u2019s guest post.\nFirst I want to thank Melissa for allowing me to be a guest blogger on her site. Let me start by introducing myself.\nMy name is Jena Jake. I am the mother of two amazing daughters. One is diagnosed ASD. I am a counselor and the author of a program called BUFFERS and BREAKTHROUGHS. BUFFERS and BREAKTHROUGHS is a coping program designed to support caregivers of children with ASD. The program encourages parents to use their unique circumstances of having a child with ASD to go to the next level in the Parent\u2019s life.\nBUFFERS is a 7 step acronym that guides participants step by step to actually \u201cBUFFER\u201d themselves to be able to \u201cBreakthrough\u201d to live more consciously with passion and purpose! Buffers and Breakthroughs is about embracing Autism on your own terms!\nI asked myself, as a parent of a child with ASD what would I most want to know? For me the answer is simple; how do I live the rest of my life with ASD and all of it challenges? Furthermore, how do I live the amazing and passionate life I have always wanted? Well, that is what I am going to discuss today.\nVictoria Osteen, wife of the famous orator Joel Osteen wrote that one has to let go of one thing to grab onto to something better. My first suggestion is to be willing to let go of the \u2018status quo\u2019 to be able to be free to grab something better. Living better is living more consciously! Ask any expert and they will tell you must have a plan. Put yourself on your to-do list and make a plan of what is working and discard what is not! That is the \u2018B\u2019 in my BUFFERS program, which stands for Boundaries, Breaks and Balance. Know what your boundaries are and make sure you keep yourself on your to-do list. Take self-care seriously to master balance. Remember, taking breaks is not a luxury but a necessity!\nStart your roadmap at the end and work backward. Where do I want to end up? How did I get there? What was the step before that? Keep asking yourself these questions until you arrive where you are right now.\nRemember you are the parent of a child with ASD, so in my opinion you are already a high performer! Start thinking of yourself as one! What do high performers do?\nBesides having a plan and a roadmap they have a toolbox to go and pull out the right \u201ctool\u201dat the right moment. They know how to manage a crisis and put out fires.\nA toolbox means everything: from ensuring a successful outing to getting through a crisis, to looking at the glass half full! For example, going to a restaurant? What will I need to have a great meal? What reinforcing items could I take? Ipad, ipod,and headphones? Check! Favorite toy? Check! If an unexpected crisis arises no worries! I have a plan for that too! I am prepared to handle it and keep moving.\nI have a BUFFERS checklist that I run in a crisis situation. The checklist is part of the program I created. I run the steps to the acronym BUFFERS to keep myself calm and engaged in making the situation better and keep moving on. By Keeping a bad moment in check it is possible to maintain the positive healthy environment you need to move forward. A bad moment is just that, a bad moment. It does not signify a bad life! Having a go-to tool will keep you on task and not let the situation get the best of you!\nMostly, I use the first \u2018F\u2019 in my program, it stands for \u2018Find Something Bigger than Yourself \u2018 for example: a prayer to please help me get through this moment or asking for strength in the moment. I use \u2018U: \u2018Unearth New Territory\u2019 to help me ask myself what new idea can I bring to this moment?\nOnce I am focused on something \u2018new\u2019 and not how sorry I feel for myself is when things start to change! You are the only one who has the power to give you a new life. That is what high performers do they adapt and overcome by thinking out of the box!\nNext time you are having a raw moment take a breath and think of one new thing to gain back control and get things going in your favor. You will be amazed as to what you come up with! You may have a hard life because you live with Autism. Autism never takes the day off and is always around yelling and screaming and making its presence known like an uninvited relative that won\u2019t go away! It can be a feeling of heaviness like dragging a hundred pound weight everywhere you go! Well, is it a 100 pounds of coal or 100 pounds of gold? What is unique about your circumstances that makes you valuable or marketable to others? You get to choose! You are an expert in Autism and for sure an expert in your own child! You understand on an intimate level, what loving someone with a chronic illness is like! You have compassion and empathy! What other unique skills do you bring to the table? For Instance I am a counselor. Autism and counseling were two of the strongest forces in my life. I used them as assets that lead me to the creation of my program and here I am today\u2026ready and willing to use my unique gifts to help others! I invite you to do the same and join me! How can you use your unique gifts to serve another in some way? There is nothing like feeling good because you helped someone else. That will make you feel great and realize that you just found something bigger than yourself. In this author\u2019s opinion, that is something that Autism can\u2019t take away because it is much bigger! I hope that this post has helped and motivated you to action! Please respond I love feedback! Visit me at. Thanks!",

I joined to help people and I still work on the ethic of\ntreat people how you would want to be treated\nIt makes sense. Think about it. Put yourself in the others shoes.\nThe Winsor report has done nothing to officers but bring the morale down even more than it should. I am sure if he was a serving officer he would understand more about what we are about.\nWe work shifts and so we don\u2019t get much downtime in between with friends and family and so it can be quite an unsociable career in some respects, on the other hand it can be sociable with the people you work with. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some you wouldn\u2019t pee on if they were on fire, others are colleagues and others are friends, but at the end of the day we work as a team.\nThe Winsor report is going to make it so much harder to be who we want to be.\nWe would all love to be tip top fit, and some manage it, others don\u2019t have the adequate down time to themselves to do the fitness, so are the job going to give \u2018downtime\u2019 to do training as they have in the armed forces and fire service? I think fitness is paramount for front line policing especially in this day and age, but by decreasing the amount we take home will cause a deficit for bills and less money to belong to a gym or a club.\nWe all talk of the publics human rights but where are ours to have the time and ability to do these things?\nThe police seem quite focused, as they should on human rights for the public, but it comes to light that we don\u2019t always practice what we preach.\nAn example is where officers have had to sit on a seal for a crime, and it stays on for sometime, but there are no facilities for the officers made open to them. We are talking about the very basics of having no where to go to the toilet, or to heat up a meal or to even stretch their legs. Female officers have been advised to buy a \u2018shewee\u2019 in order to save embarrassment rather than the usual, but what if it was a different call of nature? What then? Are we supposed to tell officers to find a bush for that?! Surely not! If a seal is put on and facilities are not there then surely a \u2018portaloo\u2019 of some description should be made available? If we did that to the general public there would be outcry.\nWe have had our social clubs, canteens and gym equipment taken away and yet they want us to be looking after ourselves better. I know a lot of officers who suffer with IBS and IBD due to the inability to be able to keep to a healthy lifestyle and diet. Keeping us in the service until we are sixty isn\u2019t going to help.\nThen there are officer numbers.\nIt has been known that the goalposts often get changed when it suits, for example, a student officer when tutored will not be counted unless push comes to shove and minimal staffing becomes an issue, therefore you are left with perhaps two officers for the whole shift, one of which may only be in their first day or week. How is that fair on both the public or staff?\nI will reiterate that I do love my career and the opinions that I write are only mine and no reflection of my employers but I ask of you- The majority of us work very hard under very hard circumstances- it may be a fatal RTC, a sudden death, a domestic, or public order that we have to attend- we treat people with the respect that they deserve so we are only asking that you put yourselves in our shoes and think \u2018how would we want to be treated?\u2019\nIt just seems to be going from bad to worse\u2026\u2026\u2026\nAverage civilian has no idea what police work entails. The stress, confrontations & things which are not \u2018nice\u2019. Therefore they have little sympathy; they have their own problems to deal with. Maybe the police need a union \u2013 their existing federations etc. seem to lack political nous. That would certainly chime with the public.",

    "answer": "The author believes that the Winsor report has negatively impacted the morale of police officers and will make it harder for them to be who they want to be. The report is also seen as a hindrance to maintaining fitness due to decreased income and less money for gym memberships.",

I wish we had the answers we really need \u2014 they're just not here yet.\"\nCommittee member Derek Gracia pointed out that low class size was the number one priority when the two towns agreed to fully regionalize.\n\"At a minimum we have to deliver that ... Anything below that fails miserably,\" he said.\n\"We kind of come to a point in our budget cycle over the last 2 years where our costs are just far exceeding what our revenue is,\" said Dr. Huizenga. \"And John, to your point, I think the towns have made very clear that even our base budget is going to require an override ... When you're at that point where that base budget is going to have class sizes exceeding 30 from K-12 it puts us in an interesting quandary where yes, there's no line drawn in the sand but we're kind of at a point in our system ... where something has to be done and so my question is ... why not go to the public and ask for the educational program we feel we can best deliver on the future of their kids?\"\nMr. Olivieri argued that a more realistic number of what the towns would be willing to pay would be better to support.\n\"A number of folks have told me that Freetown doesn't even want to put the ballot out there to have an override, so what does that do?\" Said Mr. Olivieri. \"I'm more interested in focusing down and getting as close to what is realistic as we can as opposed to going through this process that just drags out and causes a lot of angst for people.\"\nCommittee member Robert Noguiera argued that the voters in Freetown can get 10 signatures together to have a warrant article put on the town meeting warrant by petition if the elected officials are against allowing the voters to have their say with an override.\nThe motion to accept $33.7 million as the initial budget number was approved by majority vote.\nFollowing the budget vote, the school committee discussed the district's next move concerning its superintendent-dilemma as a cancelled search has left them without a permanent replacement for Dr. Huizenga.\nMassachusetts Association of School Committees representative and liaison to the district throughout the search process Glenn Koocher provided Mr. Goodfellow with a list of 62 names of potential candidates including retired superintendents to serve as interim while the district waits for the search process to reboot.\nThe committee decided to assign Mr. Goodfellow and Vice Chairman Robert Clark to interview a selection of candidates and ultimately determining the one who will be hired as interim.

    "context": "Suspenseful and often chilling the movie Beyond the Reach showcases Michael Douglas in a role that engages his signature performance. His cold and calculating character here may offer a few scenes of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for some, but it\u2019s an acting treat you won\u2019t want to miss. Together with up and coming actor Jeremy Irvine the two put on a cat-and-mouse show that\u2019s so intense at times, I found myself on the edge of my seat. Take a ride into a rocky desert with this sizzling drama.\nBen (Jeremy Irvine), one of the best trackers in Arizona, and Elaina (Hanna Mangan Lawrence) his girlfriend have been living in a trailer on the edge of the Mojave Desert for some time. Having been accepted at a college in Denver however, Elaina feels she must take the opportunity and assures Ben she can keep the long distance relationship going in spite of a long absence. As she leaves the trailer Ben gets a call from Sheriff Rob (Ronny Cox) that he has a tracker job for him.\nHe walks into the police station and gets introduced to John Madec (Michael Douglas) one of the most powerful international businessmen. Madec\u2019s intention is to take down a bighorn Sheep to fill the final space among the other big game trophies on his wall at home. Ben\u2019s Leary about the trip since a bighorn is the rarest hunting license one can get for big game and it takes more than big money to get one. Sheriff Rob assures him that everything is in order and he\u2019s set to go. When they arrive at a basin in the desert however, Ben insists on seeing the license. So begins a story steeped in suspense and driven by egotistical arrogance.\nFirst time director Jean-Baptiste L\u00e9onetti gets a lucky break with the fine cast, nice script and an excellent cinematic crew. He paces his film well creating good characters and putting them in a tight situation that has little chance of a good outcome. To create the best mood for his man verses beast script, he pits the headstrong and heavily armed Madec against a strong willed deputy, both in the hellish setting of an unforgiving desert basin. His cameras roll closing in on his two subjects as the audience witnesses a terror hunt that continues to a devilish finale.\nEven though you can see evidence of a small budget, Douglas holds back nothing creating his corrupt character in the vein of his Nicholas Van Orton in The Game. Cunning and diabolical he hunts for forbidden game then turns himself on a human target with relentless rage. Although getting up there in age, you\u2019d never know it as he delivers a tough skinned performance in the heat of the desert with challenging surroundings. Not bad for a 70 year old.\nBeyond the Reach has been rated R for some violence. It also contains a very gruesome scene of death. Not for the timid or those that are easily grossed out.\nFINAL ANALYSIS: A well-acted and photographed film for suspense lovers. (C+)\nAdditional Film Information:\nCast: Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irvine, Ronny Cox, Hanna Mangan Lawrence\nDirected by: Jean-Baptiste L\u00e9onetti\nGenre: Crime, Thriller, Drama\nMPAA Rating: R for some violence\nRunning Time: 1 hr. 35 min\nRelease Date: April 17, 2015\nDistributed by: Roadside Attractions/Lionsgate",

    "context": "10 of the Most Common Problems You May Encounter with Your Roof\nIt isn\u2019t at all uncommon for your roof to experience damage, but urn into a huge problem if it is left untreated. It can be just a minor leak, and it can create a lot of damage, especially to the interior of your home, such as ruined ceilings, wallboard and insulation. Therefore, it is very important that you take the time out of your day to regularly inspect your roof. This helps to detect minor issues long before they develop into major problems that require costly repairs. Here are 10 of the most frequent issues that you may come across with your roof:\nProblem #1: The Sun.\nOver time, the UV rays from the sun can result in the deterioration of your roof. This is particularly true if you have an asphalt singled roof. The asphalt shingles can dry, blister and crack, eventually coming loose and possibly falling off. If this happens, the sheathing underneath will be exposed \u2013 as will the roof \u2013 to the various weather elements.\nProblem #2: Snow and Ice.\nYour roof can really take a beating from snow and ice. As the build-up of snow and ice melt, the water will make its way beneath the flashing and shingles where it will eventually refreeze. When it refreezes, it will lift the flashing and shingles, allowing for more water to seep through. The cycle can then start all over again. Eventually, the flashing and shingles can come loose or you can just have bad leaks on your hands. In either case, it is important to check your roof each spring if you live in an area where snow, ice and freezing are conditions you deal with regularly.\nProblem #3: Strong Gusts of Wind.\nAnother issue that you have is the wind, and it doesn\u2019t mean that there has to be a strong storm coming through the area for you to deal with strong winds. You can have strong gusts of wind on a perfectly clear, sunny day, and these gusts of wind can be strong enough to either lift or tear your shingles off of your roof. So, keep an eye out on the ground for pieces or entire shingles.\nProblem #4: Overhanging Tree Limbs.\nTree limbs that hang over your roof can rub against the surface of your roof causing the protective top layer of your shingles to be rubbed away. If branches were to fall onto your roof from a nearby tree, this can cause even more damage, such as puncturing a hole in your roof. So, on a regular basis, it is important to take the time to trim back tree limbs as much as possible away from your roof. If there is a roof that appears to pose a threat to the roof and your home as a whole, it is a good idea to have the entire thing removed as soon as possible.\nProblem #5: Birds/Small Wildlife.\nBirds and other small wildlife can do more damage to your roof than you could ever imagine. For instance, woodpeckers would make look for insects along the eaves by making holes. These holes, believe it or not, can get pretty large and the wood would be left exposed to moisture, which means that it could eventually rot. Another example would be racoons. These animals would want to try to get into attic and may try to pull up your flashing and shingles trying to get inside. Any damage that you notice from wildlife needs to be repaired immediately and you should try to figure out ways that would discourage the animals from messing with your roof.\nProblem #6: Insects.\nAs a general rule, insects mess with the foundation of a home. However, they can do damage to your roof as well. For example, carpenter ants, termites and similar insects will chew at fascia boards and the eaves of your roof. Insects tend to be what attracts other wildlife to your roof as well. Try to eliminate the insects and you may just eliminate the wildlife problem at the same time.\nProblem #7: The Flashing.\nFlashing is located around vents, chimney and the edge of your roof \u2013 all of these areas can allow water to seep in for damage to develop. Around vent flashing, there is caulking, but it often dries out and shrinks. As for the edge flashing, it can become damaged when you deal with snow buildup and ice dams during the winter. Therefore, it is a good idea to try to avoid using sharp tools and avoid hammering on the flashing and to check the caulking on a regular basis so that it can be replaced before it deteriorates too bad.\nProblem #8: Clogged Gutters.\nIf you\u2019re going to have a gutter system on your home, you need to make sure that it works. If your gutters are broken or clogged, they can\u2019t do their job. Water will back up and eventually seep into the roof eaves. When this happens, the wood will rot over time. Therefore, debris needs to be cleaned out on a regular basis and the gutters need to be inspected routinely for broken seams and brackets. It is recommended to consider adding a gutter guard system to keep debris out, which makes your job easier.\nProblem #9: Poorly Ventilated Attic.\nYour roof\u2019s lifespan can quickly be shortened if your attic is not insulated properly. When your attic gets too hot over the summer months, the roof\u2019s shingles \u201cbake\u201d from underneath. This causes them to dry out and become brittle. If the attic is too hot during the winter months, then the snow will melt at a fast pace and the water will refreeze. This continues repeatedly and causes the shingles and flashing to lift continuously.\nProblem #10: Lack of Roof Maintenance.\nIf you fail to keep up with your roof maintenance, then you are going to have a host of problems. Most problems will start off small, such as the need to clean your clogged gutters or remove tree limbs that are hanging over your roof. However, when these issues are not corrected over a reasonable amount of time, they can result in significant roof damage. Therefore, regular inspections and routine maintenance can easily extend the lifespan of your home\u2019s roof and also save you a considerable amount of money in the long run.\nIf you would like to schedule an inspection of your roof by a team of roofing professionals or need us to look at a problem that you found during your own inspection, give us a call at C and K Roofing.",

Futures, however, remain anchored by plentiful supplies of market-ready cattle and weak cash markets as fed cattle in the U.S. Plains this week traded about $1 to $2 per cwt lower than a week ago at around $105 per cwt. \"It still looks like we have a few weeks of pressure left in front of us in September with rising cattle numbers seasonally,\" said Rich Nelson, chief strategist with Allendale Inc. \"Next week we will have a push of higher (cattle) numbers available for packers to buy. I think this market is bracing for this next round of lower prices,\" he said. The most-active CME October live cattle contract was the only lower contract, settling down 0.250 cent at 105.150 cents per pound. Deferred contracts were 0.300 to 0.775 cent higher. Feeder cattle futures also edged up, following gains in live cattle and as corn futures resumed a recent decline that could lower costs for fattening cattle. Most-active CME October feeders closed 0.250 cent higher at 143.550 cents per pound while November ended up 0.275 cent at 143.950 cents. Lean hog futures settled mostly higher, underpinned by expectations for a seasonal increase in packer demand as they fill orders this month for National Pork Month features in October. Front-month October hog futures finished 0.050 cent higher at 61.450 cents per pound and December hogs up 0.025 cent to 58.050 cents. Markets will be closed on Monday for the U.S. Labor Day holiday.

Not pizza, not soup, not a sandwich and certainly not a salad; at least not for me.\nSo I was pleased as can be to learn that Thai 9 in Scarborough had set up shop in The Old Port. Before too long, a Thai attack hit me and I was able to summon up my standing lunch date with short notice.\nAesthetically, I like the place with its tasteful, minimal decor and low lighting. You can also snag a seat by the window for good people watching. But I wasn\u2019t there to meditate or gaze, I was there to fill my belly.\nFull disclosure, I am fighting \u2013 and winning \u2013 the battle of the bulge, and wanted nothing more than a huge pile of noodles but couldn\u2019t bring myself to order them. Instead, I opted for an order of fresh spring rolls with chicken ($7) and the wonton soup ($4).\nThe spring rolls were filled with lettuce, cilantro, onion, bean sprouts, mint, carrot, noodle and chicken and were rolled in rice paper. But here\u2019s the thing; it was the smallest amount of chicken I\u2019ve ever seen. I would be surprised if it was more than an ounce. Essentially, these were lettuce rolls. Sure, they were fresh but were lackluster and not very good.\nAs for the soup, it too seemed fresh but the bowl had about three wontons in it and a whole lot of broth. Suffice to say, I was starving 45 minutes later.\nMy friend ordered the Triple Delight ($10). This was chicken, beef and roasted pork and shrimp sauteed with ginger and assorted vegetables in a ginger sauce. She reported back to me that her dish was fresh and that she appreciated that the veggies were fresh and crunchy, though perhaps a bit on the raw side.\nWe were both underwhelmed, awash with disappointment.\nI couldn\u2019t let it go, so in a move even I didn\u2019t anticipate, I went back for more three days later.\nThis time I colored outside the lines of my so-called healthy eating and order Lo Mein with chicken ($8). The portion was generous and the egg noodles were pan fried with snow peas, napa cabbage, carrot, mushroom, onion and bean sprouts. Ah, the sweet taste of redemption.\nMeanwhile, I grabbed takeout for a colleague who chose Pad Saeaw with chicken ($8). This is pan-fried large noodles with egg, broccoli and carrots in a sweet soy sauce. I got word from her that the vegetables were cooked perfectly, not raw, but with just enough bite to them to make them interesting instead of mushy. She also chimed in that the dish on a whole tasted fresh and not overdone and not greasy like some of the Asian noodle take-out you can get.\nThe moral of the story is this: Second chances aren\u2019t just for people. I am glad I gave one to Thai 9, and I know I\u2019ll be back to try dishes like the Cashew Nut, Dumplings and Golden Crispy Tofu.\nAimsel Ponti can be contacted at 791-6455or at:",

    "context": "Syrah, Shiraz, and Petite Sirah\nSyrah and Shiraz are the same grape, but Petite Sirah is completely different. It\u2019s confusing, but we\u2019re here to help. Wines labeled \u201cShiraz\u201d have become increasingly popular over the past few decades, as have wines made from Syrah - often labeled with place names like \"Hermitage\" or \"C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie.\" Petite Sirah is well known in the United States, and causes understandable confusion with its name. In the following article, we will discuss the various terms and grapes so that you can impress and educate your wine-loving friends.\nSyrah = Shiraz Syrah/Shiraz \u2260 Petite Sirah\nSyrah\nThe origins of Syrah/Shiraz have been debated over the years, with competing theories claiming Persia, Sicily, and the Rh\u00f4ne Valley as birthplaces for the grape. DNA analysis performed at University of California, Davis in 1998 points to the Rh\u00f4ne-Alps area in France as the original home of Syrah. The grape has spread all over the world, with the two most famous Syrah regions being the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley in France and various states in southeastern Australia - where it is known as Shiraz. Excellent Syrah is also grown in regions like California, Washington State, Hawke\u2019s Bay New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Tuscany, Switzerland, and Spain.\nKeeping in mind once more that Syrah and Shiraz are the same grape, let\u2019s examine places in the world where Syrah is made. Syrah is a French word, and most examples are found in the northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley. Wines from areas like Hermitage, C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, Crozes-Hermitage, and Saint-Joseph are made from 100% Syrah. They follow the European tradition of labeling wine by the place where it was made, rather than the grapes in the bottle. Syrah is also used for blending in southern Rh\u00f4ne regions, like Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape.\nIn general, wines made from Syrah are either from Europe, or are meant to evoke a traditional European style of winemaking. In California, for example, a wine might be labeled as \"Syrah\" rather than \"Shiraz,\" to imply an influence from France rather than Australia. Wines labeled \"Syrah\" are generally understood to be drier, more acidic, and earthier than Shiraz, which is known to be soft, full-bodied, and fruity. The difference between the styles can be attributed to numerous factors, including climate and winemaking technique. Shiraz usually comes from warmer climates with more modern winemaking, while Syrah comes from cooler climates with more traditional winemaking. Again, genetically, Syrah and Shiraz are the same grape. Imagine them as a single person wearing different clothes - Syrah is the formal outfit and Shiraz is the more casual outfit.\nShiraz\nPronounced \u201cshee-RAZZ\u201d in Australia, or \u201cshuh-RAHZ,\u201d in the United States, Shiraz has become a more recognizable name than Syrah to most. The term is assumed to have originated in Australia where the grape has been grown since the nineteenth century. There are numerous regions in Australia that are famous for Shiraz, including the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\nAustralian Shiraz is usually very full-bodied with a dark fruit character, spice, and high alcohol. It became exceedingly popular in the early 2000s, but has become less fashionable since. Some American consumers are unaware of the world-class Shiraz producers in Australia, and incorrectly assume that all Shiraz is inexpensive and lacking in character. The downturn in the Australian wine market means there are great deals to be found on some of the best Shiraz in the world.\nThe term Shiraz is also used by wineries throughout the new world in places like Chile, Argentina, South Africa, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the choice to call a wine Shiraz, rather than Syrah, implies that it is similar to the fruity, jammy wines of Australia.\nPetite Sirah\nOriginating in France where it is called \"Durif,\" Petite Sirah is now best known in the United States. The word \u201cPetite\u201d seems to suggest the wine might be light and thin, but it\u2019s actually a big wine made from small grapes. Smaller grapes have more skin per ounce of liquid, and therefore make wines with a deeper color and stronger tannins. Petite Sirah is full-bodied and powerful, with firm tannins and flavors of blackberry and plum. It\u2019s found in single varietal wines, as well as in blends - most commonly with Zinfandel or Cabernet. Given that Petite Sirah is rare outside of the United States, its wines are considered iconically American.",

He was 78.\n\u201cChuck was an inspiration to all of us,\u201d said Tom Petersen, who spent 25 years as a circuit judge in Miami-Dade. \u201cWe were all better people for having known him.\u201d\nNever miss a local story.\nThe two met in 1966 when Petersen moved to Miami after law school. \u201cHe was responsible for me getting my first job with the State Attorney\u2019s office in the diversion program for first offenders,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cSy [Gelber] was his mentor and my mentor and we\u2019ve all remained friends.\u201d\nChuck was a man for all seasons. A talented guy who had a tremendous range of interests. A judge. An author. A consultant. A professor. A photographer.\nJudge Tom Petersen.\nDefense lawyer James McGuirk, a former assistant state attorney, also came of age with Edelstein in Gerstein\u2019s office. They met as 17-year-old freshman at the University of Florida.\n\u201cWe were young idealists. He grew older but he never changed. He became a father, a prosecutor, an appellate lawyer, a judge and a court management specialist \u2014 and always an idealist,\u201d McGuirk said. \u201cThe best thing I can say about him is Seymour Gelber thought the world of him.\u201d\nGelber, now 97, agreed. \u201cOh boy, was he idealistic,\u201d he said. \u201cA great lawyer. Loved the law.\u201d Edelstein didn\u2019t brandish his stature, Gelber said, \u201cbut he let himself be heard. He spoke out and was a powerful speaker. He wasn\u2019t going to win over the world but he was my man.\u201d\nGov. Bob Graham appointed Edelstein to the bench in 1979. He later coordinated the design and construction and renovation of courtrooms and buildings in Miami-Dade as an assistant court administrator and director of court facilities for the 11th Judicial Circuit.\nEdelstein, an outdoors man and marathon runner, turned into an award-winning photographer in 2015 when Defenders of Wildlife awarded his photograph of a wild wolf family in Alaska\u2019s Denali National Park its grand prize. He was also a law professor and director of the trial advocacy program at the University of Miami.\nThe Neptune, New Jersey-born Edelstein spearheaded reforms in caseload management practices in Miami-Dade, Seminole and Brevard counties. The Criminal Law Section of the Florida Bar honored him in 2015 for his role in reducing jail population.\nIn one of his letters to the Miami Herald\u2019s editorial pages, Edelstein, then a senior judge in 2008, wrote: \u201cEffective, relevant education and decent-paying jobs give kids a stake in the community and a future with hope and dignity. With a paycheck and self-esteem, crime rates will fall.\u201d\nEdelstein\u2019s survivors include his wife Diane, his children Shari and Amy, four grandchildren, and his brother Joel. A memorial will be at 5 p.m. July 20 at Newman Alumni Center at the University of Miami, 6200 San Amaro Dr., Coral Gables.

    "context": "Among historical events that have left an enduring influence, the Second World War is certainly one that lives up to its name. Its European, African and American components are adequately depicted, but the Asian experience, while not entirely absent, is quite under-represented. And this is despite the early 20th century being quite a tumultuous era for the region \u2013 older conflicts (the China-Japan War) segueing into the World War, which in its wake, sparked a spate of decolonisation and freedom struggles, some of them violent. But there are promising voices appearing, such as Malaysian lawyer-turned-author Tan Twan Eng with his first two intricately-crafted, evocative novels of the war and its effects in his ethnically-diverse homeland.\nMemories of turbulent times, difficult loyalties: Tan Twan Eng\u2019s Malaysia in war novels\nth\nThe war is the main component, but Tan\u2019s canvas stretches much wider in both his debut The Gift of Rain (2007) and The Garden of Evening Mists (2012) to encompass the themes of loyalty and betrayal, sacrifice, survival and guilt, the persistence of memory, conflicting demands of collaboration and resistance, complications of a mixed-race heritage, and varied paths to redemption. All these are overlaid by a refined Eastern sensibility, a credible supernatural motif and the aesthetics of a Japanese garden and its laying out.\nSet in the northwestern coastal state of Penang in peninsular Malayasia before, during and after the war, The Gift of Rain is narrated in flashback by Anglo-Chinese business magnate Philip Hutton, who is the sole survivor of a prominent English family running a trading firm in colonial era-Malaysia. The memories are triggered when he has an unexpected visitor, connected to someone from his past.\nBefore the war, Hutton, who has a cordial but difficult relationship with his paternal and maternal sides (especially his maternal grandfather), befriends the Japanese consul, Hayato Endo. While Endo becomes his preceptor in the new martial art of aikido and its philosophy, Hutton serves as the diplomat\u2019s guide to the area, but realises, as the Japanese invade, that Endo was sent to reconnoitre the area \u2013 and Hutton unknowingly aided him.\nUnder the occupation, both find themselves grappling to reconcile their friendship and loyalty to each other and to their countries (and in Hutton\u2019s case, his family). Traversing a perilous path, Philip agrees to assist the Japanese and Endo in a bid \u2013 unsuccessful \u2013 to keep his family safe, but at the same time, passes intelligence to the guerrilla fighters including of the famous Force 136, which include his best friend Kon, the son of a local Chinese triad boss. But there are tensions with the Communist partisans, hardline Japanese administrators and many unpleasant decisions and actions for Hutton, who does not emerge unscathed out of the war.\nEven afterwards, there is a further unpleasant but inevitable decision in respect to Endo, with whom Hutton turns out to have a centuries-long association (revealed in the supernatural component). It is the postwar visit of a Japanese widow, once a love interest of Endo, that serves as the catalyst for the memories to come out.\nBeginning with the evocative line: On a mountain above the clouds once lived a man who had been the gardener of the Emperor of Japan, The Garden of Evening Mists is narrated by newly retired Malaysian Supreme Court judge Yun Ling Teoh and takes place over three different periods.\nAlso in flashback, it begins in the 1980s with the judge suddenly resigning and moving to the Cameron Highlands, where she had lived after the war. There she seeks to make sense of her life and experiences before the aphasia she has been diagnosed with cripples her speech and memory.\nThe World War is a backdrop for the first story arc, when Yun and her elder sister Yun Hong, of a prominent Straits Chinese family, are taken to an internment camp when the Japanese invade. The only survivor, Yun develops a fervent hate for the Japanese and energetically participates in the war crimes trials. She also visits the highlands where lives taciturn Nakamura Aritomo, the aforesaid gardener, who is crafting Yugiri or the garden of the evening mists, and asks him to build a garden in her sister\u2019s memory. He refuses, but instead takes her on as an apprentice and teaches her the art even as the Communist insurgency erupts in Malaysia and serves as the backdrop of the second arc.\nBringing both arcs together is the present when Japanese historian (and failed Kamikaze pilot) Yoshikawa Tatsuji visits Yun and seeks information about Aritomo and his garden \u2013 the only surviving one. The flashback leads both Yun to re-examine her memories and morally ambiguous actions of both her and Aritomo in wartime and later and her survivor guilt.\nDespite a languid pace \u2013 especially as far as the pre-war era is depicted and aesthetical details are mentioned, both of Tan\u2019s works are epic in scope as they incorporate and deal with a range of human emotions, motivations and dilemmas to offer an intense, invaluable and engrossing experience of the World War and its lingering effects in Southeast Asia.\n(26.10.2014 \u2013 Vikas Datta is a senior assistant editor at IANS.

    "context": "I consider myself to have been saved on September 22, 2010. However, I only pursued the Lord in a lackadaisical fashion for some time after that. The turning point was about this time last year. I distinctly remember sitting in the restroom at about 4:45 PM on a Saturday, on the phone with a friend, asking if \u201cthat Mount Zion church still had their Saturday night service going on?\u201d\nWell, the rest, as we know it, is history. It would be impossible to sum up an entire year\u2019s worth of experience, spiritual growth, development, new friends, and knowledge I\u2019ve gained in so many respects. By any objective standard, a third party observer could take a look at me and say I was a fairly successful person \u2013 I\u2019m halfway through law school, I owe almost nothing in student loans, I\u2019ve kept my health, et cetera.\nBut they could have said that a year ago, too. And the truth is, a year ago, I was so lost in my spiritual and personal walk that it wasn\u2019t even funny. I attended the law school\u2019s Halloween party in 2011. I can\u2019t peg a precise date when I started attending Mount Zion, but I know it was less than two weeks after that party. And it wasn\u2019t exactly the right place to be. (picture not safe for families)\nI could go on about how the summer of 2012 was probably the best summer I\u2019ve had. And the title picture I used encapsulated the entire summer in a profound way. We were at The Greene and on a whim I decided to give this guy a dollar (the only dollar all five of us had), at which time he starts playing Amazing Grace. Some guy jumps out of a passing car, runs up to us, shouts \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d while showing us an enormous tattoo of Jesus and John 3:16 on his arms.\nSo then Ashley (the young lady in the picture) joins him in hooping and hollering about Jesus. Meanwhile, I was completely stoked, it made my whole day. For that matter, it made my week. All my life, I\u2019ve come to expect the polar opposite \u2013 if you mention God in public, you\u2019ll get shouted down and told to be quiet. Not here, and not this day!\nRather than attempt to describe my entire experience since then, I\u2019m just going to make a shout out to everyone who played a role in my spiritual growth, breakthroughs, and general peace that I\u2019ve achieved lately. This is in no particular order, except for who came to mind.\nFirst off, I remain forever thankful for Jesus. For dying for me and loving me forever and never giving up, even when I\u2019m an intractable sinner. I\u2019m thankful that Your grace overflows and is enough for all of us. I know that I repeatedly fail at living up to Your standards, and I repent those sins.\nI\u2019m thankful for my parents, both of which have provided financial, moral, and (in the case of my father) spiritual support and growth over the past year. I hope you understand how much you\u2019ve managed to do for me, Dad.\nI\u2019m thankful to have been blessed with a growing circle of friends that are also pressing into Jesus with all their hearts. I\u2019ve leaned on a lot of you over the past year, especially when looking for spiritual support. That immediate list includes, in no particular order, Brent and Cliff Engels, Matt and Clint Holderman, their mom Aurora, Eric McComas, Jake Crawford, Nathan Stroble and his father Larry, Tiffany Presley, Caitlin and Stephen O\u2019Guin, and their father Jeff for his timely and often hard-hitting sermons that led to great breakthrough.\nHats off to Tommie Culpepper for his advice that probably meant the difference between making it through law school or not. And for Grace, who is probably the only teenage girl I know of who doesn\u2019t tune out when the subject turns to politics or economics.\nA salute to Rosemary Bradford, Wanda Peden, and Glenn Laack for ramrodding the logistics behind healing prayer training this past summer. To the other healing prayer team members who I\u2019ve received enormous breakthroughs with \u2013 Sarah Blosser, Ashley O\u2019Neal, Geoff Griffith, Abby Granato, Barb Beckley, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a few more here.\nTo the Monday night men\u2019s group that I haven\u2019t already mentioned \u2013 Dave Stanford, Matt Porter, Joe Martin, Rick Vice, Mike Bates, Phil Granato.\nTo Jack and Jenni McComas, for the numerous breakthroughs that have occurred at SHOP, when the Lord opens up the floodgates of heaven and truly lets it rains.\nTo the friends in Northern Kentucky who have contributed to my growth, too \u2013 Katie Smolkovich and Sarah Burress. You guys are some of the only friends I still have in the area.\nTo everyone else who played a role, I hope I\u2019m not forgetting anyone. Caleb, Carson, Dani, Sunny, Keith, Shannon, Mandie, Paige\u2026 and yeah, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve forgotten a LOT of people. But I\u2019m still thankful for everyone nevertheless.\nHere is to sincerely hoping that 2013 is an even greater year. Praise the Lord! Nothing that has happened has been an accident. It has all been in accordance with His plan.",

    "context": "(Lack OF Support From Poor & Working Class Is Keeping Financial Elites In Power)\nIt\u2019s not white people that is giving me a hard time it\u2019s our own people who refuse to support my vision to improve our inner cities in Chicago and beyond. I hold free online conferences for busy people in the convenience and privacy of their home yet very few people participate. I created Help Stop The Genocide In Americans Ghettos on Blogtalkradio in order to promote my revised book and also give my supporters an opportunity to promote their business, church events, and or their cause to my podcast audience. Again very few people participate how can I get other racial groups involved when I am unable to get blacks involved with solving black issues?\nMy book is my pledge to the inner city of Chicago residents that no one under my leadership within my organization will ever have to endure such humiliation and rejection for trying to do something positive in the black community. Those who agree with my plan to improve our inner cities in Chicago will sign one of our consent forms once I have my business in pace. My words would become a binding legal document. Since 2001, over 4000 people has been killed in Chicago alone and as a result Chicago is currently the murder capital in America. We see that nothing out there is working to end the blood shed why Black America won\u2019t embrace my plan?\nSenator Bernie Sanders is losing the presidential campaign not because of what he is saying to voters but rather in his own words \u201cPoor People Don\u2019t Vote.\u201d I voted for Bernie Sanders because his focus is on income and wealth inequality, which he argues is eroding the American middle class, he also wants to work on changing campaign finance reform. He choose to receive most of his funding directly from individual donations rather then from mega corporations. He is a democratic socialist I agree with his politics. Sanders has introduced amendments to Senate bills that promote the creation of millions of middle class jobs by investing in infrastructure, paid for by closing loopholes in the corporate and international tax system.\nSanders has long been an advocate of making college more affordable. He has spoken out against the high interest rates on federal student loans, noting that in the next ten years, the federal government will profit by as much as $127 billion from them. Sanders believes tax reform is the solution, and has developed a plan to bring matching grants from the federal and state governments to cut tuition at public universities by more than half. He has criticized both Republicans and Democrats for failing to institute reforms that will stop predatory lending practices in the student loan market.\nSanders was a civil rights organizer at the University of Chicago in the 1960s. Sanders worked for Jesse Jackson\u2019s presidential campaign. As part of his presidential platform, Sanders calls for an end to waged against black and brown Americans: physical, political, legal and economic. He said \u201cIt is an obscenity that we stigmatize so many young Americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana, but not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy. This must change..\u201d\nSanders supports banning semi-automatic weapons and closing a loophole that allows buyers to purchase guns at a gun show. He is also in favor of instant background checks for gun owners. Sanders voted for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Speaking to CNN\u2019s on State of the Union, Sanders said, \u201cI want to see real, serious debate and action on guns, but it is not going to take place if we simply have extreme positions on both sides. I think I can bring us to the middle. Sanders also dismissed the idea that gun control measures could have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, saying \u201cif you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don\u2019t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.\u201d.\u201d\nSanders has also spoken out against the privatization of prisons he.\u201d Senator Sanders introduced the \u201cJustice Is Not for Sale\u201d Act, which prohibits the United States government at federal, state and local levels from contracting with private firms to provide and/or operate detention facilities within two years. \u201cWe cannot fix our criminal justice system if corporations are allowed to profit from mass incarceration.\u201d\nIn contrast, I have experience first hand what it\u2019s like to lack support for a good cause. For 24 years my plan to help improve our inner cities in Chicago and beyond has gotten little to no support from the black community which made me write and publish my story \u201cThe Solution For Black America: Reclaiming, Rebuilding, And Restoring The Urban Ghettos In America\u201d second edition on Amazon.com I wrote my book to help raise awareness about the genocide which is taken place in our inner cities in America. I also wrote my book to promote my virtual organization the Grass Roots Community Activist Movement.\nOnce I generate enough capital from my book sell and have my management team in place then I will start my private organization the Grass Roots Community Activist Institute in Chicago. It\u2019s private because I want to exclude small minded individuals who careless about our inner city youth and their families..\nThe Grass Roots Community Activist Institute will be a gathering place for special events, food, music, and sports as well as a place to help implement security measures to make sure our neighborhood is safe vibrant and productive. This will be a lasting legacy for our community. Our Charity Programs: fundraising would be intertwined with our events to help raise money for our nonprofit organization for our programs and services we will provide within the community we will serve.\nOur charity events will be used to improve the quality of life for working and poor families in the community without regard to religion or national origin. Our nonprofit organization will focus on Education, Health & Wellness, Community Research and Social Service. Our for profit business will focus on creating a Christian business which will be intertwined with our nonprofit organization promoting Christian morals and values within the community. GRCAI is a. We welcome all Christian denominations in the faith, secular people, and moderate Muslims. We will teach the community about tolerance and how to co-exist by respecting one another belief system.

I\u2019d have to say the blow job would come out on top.\nA blowjob \u2013 or as it\u2019s known by the proper term, fellatio \u2013 is the act of performing oral sex on a man. Giving head, sucking off \u2013 whatever you call it \u2013 is often seen as a chore by women, but can be pleasurable to both.

    "context": "Causes of entropion in dogs\nEntropion can be congenital or acquired. Congenital entropion is generally the result of an anatomic defect while acquired entropion is generally the result of trauma or spasm.\nEntropion can occur in any individual of any breed but there is probably a hereditary component to canine entropion. It\u2019s commonly seen in Chow Chows, Shar-Peis, Bull Mastiffs, Rottweilers, Great Danes and St. Bernards2.\nSymptoms of entropion in dogs\nIn most cases, the skin and hair that rub over the surface of the eye result in irritation and pain. The animal will often squint their eyes, have watery eyes and pain associated with possible corneal abrasions1. Chronic inflammation can result in scarring and impact vision negatively. It is common for dogs with entropion to paw at their eyes due to discomfort.\nPrognosis of entropion in dogs\nThe short term prognosis can be guarded if secondary trauma and self injury have occurred. Entropion and resultant inflammation can result in ulcerations or abrasions of the cornea.\nThe long term prognosis\u2014with timely and appropriate intervention\u2014is generally very good. Entropion requires surgical treatment but successful surgery means your dog should be fine.\nTreatment of entropion in dogs\nThe only way to effectively treat entropion is to surgically roll the inverted portion of the eye lid back out. In cases not occurring in conjunction with ectropion (Click here to learn about canine ectropion.) the surgical approach is generally relatively simple but can be delicate and requires an experienced surgeon. Concurrent entropion and ectropion can present a very challenging surgical problem.\nPrevention of entropion in dogs\nAcquired or secondary entropion associated with trauma can be prevented or at least reduced by having any eye injury examined and treated.\nHereditary or congenital entropion probably has some genetic component. To prevent any hereditary condition means reducing the likelihood of transfer of the gene to the new generation.

    "context": "How To Protect Your Training Partners\nThere are few sports that require such close contact and cooperation with a training partner. Within the academy, there are situations where you will be called upon to use your awareness to protect your training partners from injury.\nRead also: Safety on the mats: How to be safe and minimize training injuries!\nHere are 4 Ideas for you to keep your partner safe when training at the school:\n1) Have your partner\u2019s back\nWhile rolling it is not uncommon to collide with other rolling pairs, the wall, the edge of the mat, the pillars, or other environmental variables. Many times, your opponent can not see these things and it is your job to be their eyes and prevent a potentially harmful condition. Stop the roll before your momentum crashes you into a bench or wall and resume your epic struggle safely in the center of the mat.\nFurthermore, I tell students practicing takedowns that it is THEIR responsibility to throw their partner safely. The person being thrown is placing their trust in you to be thrown safely. Take that responsibility seriously.\n2) Fingers and toes caught in kimono\nOftentimes during an intense roll fingers may become entangled in sleeves, toes caught in the folds of a wet kimono which can become painfully twisted or sprained. If you detect your partner is in such a spot, do them the favor of pausing the roll, removing the vulnerable digit and then continuing.\n3) Joints in precarious positions\nSometimes your opponent is caught completely by surprise by your sweep or takedown and may have planted their weight in a position that makes their knee vulnerable to being painfully twisted if the takedown is forced. In these cases, protect your training partner by aborting the takedown or sweep if you sense that their leg is in a awkward position.\nRecently I was preparing to perform a rolling back take that involved me rolling forward over my opponent\u2019s neck into full hooks. But the opponent, unaware of the move, turned their head in the wrong direction \u2013 which would have resulted in both of us rolling our bodyweight onto his neck and possibly causing a painful injury.\nMid-roll I released my grip and plopped ineffectively onto the mat. It was better that I relinquished the roll and saved my partner\u2019s neck than if I had continued and potentially injured their vulnerable cervical vertebrae.\n4) Letting go of submissions even without a tap\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight first: it is YOUR responsibility to tap if your limb is trapped in a submission. Your opponent doesn\u2019t know what your flexibility or pain tolerance is. That said, sometimes as more experienced belts, we must protect those who do not yet know the capacities of their own bodies.\nMost advanced students have let go of a Kimura or arm bar when the opponent was refusing to tap even though the joint was reaching its limits.\nIt can be frustrating to have a stubborn opponent look up after you released the submission and say \u201cHey! I didn\u2019t tap!\u201d, but in the larger picture it is better to not pop the joint and retain a valuable (if stubborn) training partner on the mat.\nProtect your training partners when they can\u2019t protect themselves!\nRead also: Doctor James Liu: bjj training, injuries and treatment.",
    "question": "What are some ways to keep your training partner safe during martial arts training?",
    "answer": "Some ways to keep your training partner safe during martial arts training include being aware of your surroundings to prevent collisions, taking responsibility for throwing your partner safely, pausing the roll if fingers or toes get caught in the kimono, aborting a takedown or sweep if the partner's leg is in an awkward position, and letting go of submissions even without a tap if the joint is reaching its limits.",

    "context": "Q&A with Jennifer Alderfer, CEO of HealthONE North Suburban Medical Center and CWCC Member\nHow has your life experience made you the leader you are today?My mom has always been a very influential person in my life and raised me to express gratitude, show compassion, value education, and treasure connections with others. For those reasons, I gravitated to the healthcare industry to pursue my career, where I strive to be lead both with my heart as well as with my head. Since healthcare is a people business, I feel it\u2019s important to lead my team in such a way that hopefully inspires them to create positive memorable experiences by honoring those we serve.\nHow did your previous employment experience aid in your role at North Suburban Medical Center?\nIn between undergraduate and graduate school, I worked as a certified nurse aide (CNA) at both a nursing home and in a hospital. That direct patient care experience from years ago helps me keep the patient at the center of the business and operational decisions that I make in my current position as the CEO at North Suburban. I also feel that past experience helps me, in some ways, relate more effectively to the clinicians on my team. I sometimes tell the nurses and physicians with whom I work that I am just a \u201cwant-to-be-clinician\u201d at heart.\nHow do you maintain a work/life balance?\nI am blessed to have an incredibly supportive and hands-on husband who helps care for our three children, ages 14, 12, and 10. I couldn\u2019t do my job and be the wife and mother that I want to be without his partnership and support. I also try to use technology to help me balance work and home priorities. For example, I try to leave the hospital in time to have dinner with my family, but after my kids have finished homework and gone to bed, I will log on to my email and go through other paperwork or reading from home.\nWhat have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at North Suburban Medical Center?\nOne of the challenges during my tenure at NSMC involves the transition of a patient care service provided by one physician group to another physician group. Maintaining medical staff relationships during a time of uncertainty and unfamiliarity with a new group presented some challenges, but through the experience I was reminded of the importance of providing consistent, regular communication and status updates to those impacted by the transition.\nOne of the highlights during my tenure at NSMC involves the development of the business case for, design of, and opening of the Northeast ER, a freestanding emergency department that opened in May 2012 in northeast Thornton. Being able to take this from concept to reality has been quite rewarding, especially since this emergency department provides trusted emergency care closer to the homes of some of our community members.\nWhat advice can you offer women looking for a career in the healthcare industry?\nI love working in the healthcare industry and would share with other women looking to pursue a career in healthcare that, in my experience over the past 15 years, the rewards of impacting the delivery system of patient care far outweigh any of the challenges. I can\u2019t think of a better career than one in which you\u2019re able to care for others in a very real and personal way in times of physical and emotional need or vulnerability, such as during times when health issues arise.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing women in the workplace?\nI think a challenge for both men and women in the workplace involves striking the delicate balance between work and personal priorities. For women with families to care for at home, this can sometimes be an issue, as women can feel torn between the desire to have a successful and fulfilling career and the guilt that comes with not having enough time to devote to motherhood. I also think it can be a challenge carving out time to care for oneself when busy with work. I tend to feel my best at both work and at home when I am taking care of myself, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and eating well. When I get off balance and stop working out and not getting enough rest, I feel as though things at both work and at home suffer.\nHow has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?\nI\u2019ve been blessed by mentorship throughout my career. I have found it to be helpful to have someone with more experience and professional maturity to use as a sounding board and to seek counsel on different issues. In return, I have pledged to try to pay it forward and often try to make myself available to others in undergraduate or graduate programs or early in their career seeking guidance or wanting to hear what it\u2019s like to do the work that I do.\nOn the personal side of mentorship, I have an older sister (nine years my senior) who I can talk with about raising children and balancing work and home, as she too is a professional with four children and has experienced aspects of motherhood before me. She\u2019ll be a great resource for me in a few years to share how to get through a high school graduation and how to send your oldest child off to college. I remember after I had my first baby, I called her and asked her in an admittedly rather accusatory tone why she didn\u2019t share certain details about childbirth with me, since at that time she\u2019d already had three of her four children. She wisely responded that she wanted me to focus on the positive aspects of the experience and that she barely remembered the harder aspects of childbirth. She then joked that it was why the world wasn\u2019t full of only children families \u2013 because women were resilient and tended to hold on to the positives and let go of the negatives.\nWhich other female leaders do you admire and why?\nIn my first \u201creal job\u201d after graduate school, I worked as an administrative resident at a hospital in Wichita, Kansas. There was a female physician executive on the team there in a vice president of medical staff affairs role. She taught me several things about working with physicians that I still reference today, even though that was almost 14 years ago since we worked together. She worked clinically part-time and administratively the other half of the time, was married to a physician with a busy outpatient practice of his own, and was raising three children. I admired her ability to function at a very high level in all of her many roles \u2013 as doctor, as hospital administrator, as wife, as mom, and as friend.\nI\u2019m also fortunate to work within the HealthONE system in Denver, with many high level female executives at the division level as well as various executive levels at the hospitals within the city. I admire many of these female colleagues for various reasons, but usually it is because they\u2019ve achieved a high degree of success in a demanding industry but maintained a sense of themselves as individuals and not just as professionals.",

    "context": "How are mushrooms like humans? We can both convert sunlight to vitamin D in our skin!\nSo if you eat mushrooms, you can get all the Vitamin D you need!\nMethod 1: Sun Exposure\nKey fact to know: Not all sunlight is the right wavelength to create Vitamin D. Sometimes the sun is out, but no Vitamin D synthesis can happen, either because it's too early/late in the day, or during the \"Vitamin D winter\" between around November - February (in the Chicago area).\nSo Method 1 only works when the sun is high in the sky in the full sun hours of the day (between around 10 am- 4 pm), between April and November (for folks as far north as Chicago).\nMushrooms can convert sun to Vitamin D AFTER THEY ARE HARVESTED. So you can buy regular, packaged or unpackaged mushrooms in the store (any kind my friends!) and this will work.\nSimply spread them out on a tray and put them in full sun. I do it on my window ledge. Leave them for as long as you can/want-- 30 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours, you name it.\nIf they are cut, great--that increases surface area for Vitamin D conversion. If they are not cut, put them GILLS UP.\nThe longer you leave them out, the higher the Vitamin D will rise. Even 30 minutes is worth it!\nMethod 2: UVB Light\nYou can't make Vitamin D on days when it rains. Or at 10 pm. Or in December in Chicago. But you CAN make Vitamin D from mushrooms any time, day or night, if you have a UVB light!\nLizards need UVB light exposure. You can take advantage of this to buy a UVB lizard light to use on your mushrooms. They come in all sizes and shapes.\nYou could attach one to something in your kitchen and create a permanent \"mushroom irradiation\" station. I couldn't find a good spot in my kitchen, so I decided to buy the absolute smallest UVB light I could find, keep it in a drawer, and take it out three/four times a week to shine on my mushrooms. This is what I bought.\nNote: If you have never attached a UVB light into a UVB fixture, you have to TURN the ends of the light to click in to the fixture. Don't break the light. This video showed me how.\nI shine it right over my mushrooms at a distance of about 4-5\u2033 for five minutes. I prop it up on tissue boxes to position it over my mushrooms. Super easy!\nWant more info? Google \"Vitamin D mushrooms\" for links like these:\nFinal note: some people say the Vitamin D you get from mushrooms, Vitamin D2, in inferior to Vitamin D3, which you get from your own skin. So perhaps try to get as much Vitamin D from the sun as you can, and when you can't...use mushrooms!\nScience / Proof?\nYes!",
    "question": "How can mushrooms be used to synthesize Vitamin D?",
    "answer": "Mushrooms can convert sunlight to Vitamin D even after they are harvested. This can be done by spreading them out on a tray and putting them in full sun for as long as possible. If they are cut, it increases the surface area for Vitamin D conversion. Alternatively, a UVB light can be used to make Vitamin D from mushrooms any time, day or night.",

    "context": "We live just four blocks from the Devon House, where they have splendid gardens and sell fabulous ice cream. This afternoon, Nando and I walked with the kids over to the Devon House to get some fresh air and ice cream. I had no idea I would meet a deportee with an interesting story on the way back.\nWalking back from the Devon House, Raymi decided she wanted to take a break. She sat down at the bus stop while Tatiana, Soraya, their friend MJ, and I kept on walking toward the house. When Raymi decided she had rested enough, Nando and Raymi began walking again. They stopped at the corner to let a motorcyclist pass. Instead of passing, the driver stopped to ask Nando if he was lost or looking for something. Nando told him that he lived nearby. The driver commented that the place looked expensive. Nando responded that we are visiting from the US.\nThey got to chatting, and it turns out the young man is a deportee named Dwayne. Nando told Dwayne that his wife (me) is writing a book on deportees, and offered to introduce him to me. Nando and Raymi got a lift on the motorcycle home.\nWhen they arrived, I was outside with my twin daughters, as Nando had the key. Nando introduced us, and Dwayne began to tell me his story. One of the first things he mentioned was that he is looking for a better job. I noticed he had a nice motor scooter. He said that his mother helps him out in Jamaica, but that he wishes he could be more independent. Here, he has no hope for things getting much better.\nDwayne moved to the US when he was six years old with his mother. He went to school in Cleveland, Ohio. After graduating from high school, he got mixed up in dealing drugs. He was arrested on a drug charge, convicted, and spent time in prison. Upon release from prison, Dwayne was deported to a country he barely remembered.\nDwayne told me, \u201cI\u2019m no angel, but I never killed anybody.\u201d He said the only criminal activity he had engaged in was selling drugs. He had never killed, robbed, or done any other violent crimes. Nevertheless, here in Jamaica, he faces a severe stigma for being a deportee. Other Jamaicans see that he has been abroad, and still hasn\u2019t made much of himself. So, they look down on him.\nBack in Jamaica, Dwayne is just barely getting by. He says that in the US, he had hopes and dreams. Here he has nothing. He told me he stays out of trouble. He has heard about how awful, filthy, and hot the prisons are in Jamaica. Even if he wanted to sell drugs, he doesn\u2019t have the connections to get involved in the extensive criminal enterprise in Jamaica. In the US, Dwayne\u2019s crime was selling illegal substances.\nIn the United States, over 40 percent of people over the age of twelve have used drugs ( ). I am not denying that drug use is a social problem in the US. However, it does not seem as though deporting people like Dwayne to Jamaica does anything to ameliorate the situation. There is no evidence that deporting drug offenders alleviates any of the social problems associated with drug use.\nThere is, however, evidence that deportation leads to other social problems both in the US and abroad. Dwayne, for example, left two children in the US. His eldest daughter was six when he was deported. She has grown up without a father present. They chat on the phone, and she occasionally visits, but it is not the same as having a father providing constant material and emotional support. Dwayne\u2019s mother, a hospital nurse, has to wrack her nerves about whether or not her son is surviving in Jamaica. She also must blame herself for never naturalizing him, even though he qualified for citizenship when he was eleven. Had she taken her son to be naturalized, he would not have been deported.\nIt seems wrong to deport people who qualified for citizenship when they were minors. How can we hold children responsible for not seeking citizenship? The deportees I have met all said that if they knew then what they know now, they would have become naturalized citizens. Why should they suffer the consequences for what their parents did not know \u2013 that if they did not naturalize them, they could be deported? 2, 2009\nAmerican children with Jamaican passports: Should we hold minors responsible when their parents don\u2019t apply for their citizenship?\nPosted by Tanya Golash-Boza at Thursday, July 02, 2009\nLabels: deportees, deportees in Jamaica",

Then asked me about some analysis, didn't make sense to me when I asked what was that she said the course. Again not understanding I felt like this was not going to work and asked for a refund. She then goes off about it being 8 mins and wasting time. Which I did not. I ended the chat still asking for my money. Then she emails me exaggerating time. Stretching it out arguing instead of just giving my money back or refusing to do so. In the middle of it blaming me for contacting her when I initially wanted a reading and realize I did not after she sat there for 5 mins and said nothing then asked what I wanted again after I said so in the beginning of the chat which tells me she didn't pay attention or connect.

    "context": "Before I was diagnosed in June 2011 I had just about reached a point after my losing my husband in August 2009 where it would have been nice to meet someone. However then being diagnosed with Breast Cancer somewhat stopped me in my tracks.\nTowards the end of my treatment I did start to really miss the affection and love that being with the right person brings, I jumped into something...probably far too fast and found that I couldn't start to sort myself out, which I am basically having to do from scratch, and put in the effort required to keep the relationship going. If I was in an established relationship I have no doubt it would be different.\nI think I need to be selfish for a while - no that's wrong - maybe I just need to put myself first for a change and really sort out my head after what has been the worst three years of my life. Sometimes I think I make light of it to stop myself from facing it all because when I do like now for example it makes me fall apart, and it also reminds me that the one person above all others that I want to be here to put me back together isn't and never will be again.\nIt is nearing 3 years since my husband died, 3 years since I felt his arms wrapped around me making me feel safe and loved, it makes my heart ache. I can honestly say I loved him more deeply than anyone or anything, that feeling never went away and if anything just grew stronger as time went on.\nI just feel like I want to tell people, if you have that love, the love that brings out the best in both of you in every way, hold on tight to it, never, never take it for granted and maybe you can make a wish for me, that when I am ready I will get a love like that back again someday.\nI will ardently hold that hope that one day you again have that feeling. This is a very honest post, Zoe. Thank you for sharing. Putting yourself first, focusing on your healing \u2013 it sounds like a wonderful idea and there\u2019s everything right in the concept. It sounds as though you\u2019ve had the toughest three years. Maybe now is a time for recover and recuperation?\nZoe.....\nI'm making that wish for you.... and yes, also hoping you will learn to be comfortable putting yourself in the Number One Spot. One of the women I met at NBCC said something that I will remember (despite my CRAFT chemobrain-CRAFT=Can't Remember A F'ing Thing.... spoken by a doctor at Sloan Kettering's survivor celebration!).... Anyway.... hold on to this thought:\n\"Yes, Right After ME, you come first.\" You earned it.....\nhugs...\nHi Zoe\nI understand a bit more, now that I have seen this post. I thought about what it must be like for you, when you told us that you had lost your husband. I thought about how I would feel if that had happened to me.I would not stop loving, and it would be hard, as its substantially different from a relationship which breaks up, you grieve and come out on the other side or you choose to leave. You had a good relationship and still love your husband, whom you miss. A friend of mine went through the same thing (she lost one of my close friends - Graham - her hubby suddenly). It took her a very long time to grieve, accept, and then to slowly move on and open herself to the prospect of anything even resembling a relationship.\nYou have been through hell and its going to take a long time to go through the grieving process - anger, acceptance which is the hardest and then moving on (always retaining his memory in a very special place that only he holds)especially since you lost him so suddenly (it's not fair I know). Its like the cancer, you want to feel angry because its so unfair (but you cannot direct your anger at anyone, it's just the way things have played out in life). I understand how you must miss him more now than anything else, as you have been through a rough time and you miss his love, support and hugs through all of this.\nI'm trying to understand and I think that no one would blame you if you did not rush into anything. You grieve at your own pace and when you come out on the other side you will decide what you are open to and ready for (re: relationships). Talk about him as much as you want to. We are here. It has to help?\nP.S I am making that wish for you too........Zoe\nNoelene\nNoelene\nHi Zoe, I just found your blog -- what a story you have, and so much you have been through! You are very courageous. I just lost a friend to cancer and I know just a little of how tough it can be. I can't wait to read more of your journey! And hang in there .. you will get through this! xoxox\npostingan yang bagus tentang\"Lost Love\"",

It sticks in her mind, though\u2014does this blogger really think dogs are spreading pestilence and the government is covering it up? Why haven\u2019t her beloved news venues mentioned anything about this strange new flu and its possible connection to man\u2019s best friend? Surely her beloved Cocoa isn\u2019t about to become an enemy of humanity!\nTor is a teen I\u2019d like to call my own although she really is almost too good to be true. Intelligent, pretty, comfortable in her own body, bighearted, kind, enjoys learning vocabulary, so forth and so on and, yet, she doesn\u2019t come across as a goody two shoes. Tor does have a few failings such as being a bit headstrong and not always recognizing potential consequences but, after all, she\u2019s not yet 16 years old so I think we can forgive her occasional lack of wisdom. She also has a terrific friend, Sioux, and her brother, Rody, is a rather cool guy as brothers go. Then there are her parents who named their children after the places where they conceived said children\u2014TMI indeed \ud83d\ude09\nAt first, Tor just follows what little news there is about the flu but everything takes on a much more ominous tone when her dad tells her about the first death in the hospital where he works. After the Men in Black show up on her doorstep and the CDC calls for doggy quarantine, Tor begins to morph into a bit of an avenging angel in defense of Cocoa and the other dogs in mortal danger. One twist follows another and Tor\u2019s search for truth and justice soon leads to some very uncomfortable answers.\nMs. Coley has taken a serious idea and leavened it with just enough humor and fast pacing to make it highly entertaining as well as full of suspense and I think I\u2019m going to have to read some more \u201cadventures of Tor\u201d.

    "context": "ProxySQL native HTTP server and metrics on a web UI\nIntroducing HTTP server in ProxySQL 1.4.4\nProxySQL exports a lot of metrics, all visible in the\nstats schema and queryable using any client that uses the MySQL protocol.\nThis allows to ingest metrics into external monitoring tools, like Percona PMM, grafana, Severalnines ClusterControl, graphite, datadog, and others already existing or being under development.\nAlthough we believe these monitoring tools are the preferred and right way to monitor ProxySQL, we often faced the issue that ProxySQL isn\u2019t monitored while still being evaluated. This makes very difficult the troubleshooting of performance and behavior in such scenarios. In fact, it is common that users report issues, but without metrics it is often very difficult to distinguish between a real performance bug, or a misconfiguration, or even issues completely unrelated to ProxySQL.\nFor this reason, ProxySQL version 1.4.4 introduces a new and experimental interface: a web UI to export some metrics.\nThis feature doesn't replace all the statistics already available through the Admin interface, but facilitate the troubleshooting while ProxySQL is still being evaluated and metrics are not collected into an external software.\nThis feature is not final yet, only few metrics are available, and it is subject to changes in future.\nThe web UI also provides a simple dashboard that summarizes the overall configuration and status of ProxySQL itself.\nCurrent metrics available are:\n- System Metrics: related to CPU and memory utilization\n- MySQL Metrics: related to number of MySQL connections in use (both frontends and backends), and connection pool efficiency\n- Query Cache Metrics: related to Query Cache efficiency\nConfigure HTTP server\nIf you are familiar with ProxySQL, you already know that most of its configuration can be changed at runtime.\nHTTP server is no different, and you can configure it, enable or disable it at runtime.\nCurrently there are only 2 variables related to HTTP server:\n- admin-web_enabled to either enable or disable the feature (disabled by default)\n- admin-web_port to specify the listening port\nInternally we had a long exchange of opinions on whatever HTTP server should be enabled or disabled by default. Being a new functionality, and very useful, it made sense to enable it by default. Although security was a concern: even if doesn't allow to change the configuration of ProxySQL (it is a read-only interface that exports metrics), it can be potentially used to exploit unknown vulnerabilities.\nFor this reason we made HTTP server disabled by default (\nadmin-web_enabled=false).\nIf you want to access such metrics through the web interface, you can simple enable it by configuring\nadmin-web_enabled=true. For example:\nSET admin-web_enabled='true'; LOAD ADMIN VARIABLES TO RUNTIME;\nSimilarly, to disable it:\nSET admin-web_enabled='false'; LOAD ADMIN VARIABLES TO RUNTIME;\nIf you want to make the change persistent to disk, do not forget to run\nSAVE ADMIN VARIABLES TO DISK.\nA note on the above: the HTTP server is considered part of the Admin module, therefore after you change its variables you need to use\nLOAD ADMIN VARIABLES TO RUNTIME to make the change effective, and issue\nSAVE ADMIN VARIABLES TO DISK to persist them on disk.\nOnce HTTP server is enabled, you can point your browser to port 6080 (the default), for example , and use admin-stats_credentials to login. For further security, we recommend to change the default\nadmin-stats_credentials.\nOnce you login, a dashboard with generic information is displayed:\nFrom here, you can choose a category to get useful metrics.\nThe examples below show System statistics and MySQL Connections:\nStatistics are collected even if HTTP server is not running\nHistorical statistics to be exported in the web interface are being collected even if HTTP server is disabled.\nIn other words, when you enable HTTP server you will have access to statistics collected even when HTTP server was not enabled.\nStatistics are stored in a new database file, named\nproxysql_stats.db.\nDuring the development of this new feature concerned were raised about the performance impact of this functionality, although we managed to make ProxySQL 1.4.4 even faster than ProxySQL 1.4.3!",

The UN says 70\npercent of Tajikistan's mountain forests have disappeared since\nindependence in 1991. (Photo: EurasiaNet)\n.\nBaburforov\u2019s story is typical. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of its fuel subsidies 20 years ago, many Tajiks are becoming increasingly reliant on wood. Prices for imported fuels and coal continue to rise. According to a September report by the United Nations Development Program, 70 percent of Tajikistan\u2019s mountain woodlands have disappeared since independence. The naked landscapes created by deforestation are prone to natural disasters, in particular mudslides. In addition, precious farmland is literally washing away.\nDeforestation is a symptom of Tajikistan\u2019s long-term energy crisis, says Ben Slay, senior economist at the UNDP Bureau for Europe and the CIS. \u201cPressures on Tajikistan's forestry resources are a direct result of household energy insecurity. If they [families] had reliable access to modern heat and electricity services, households would not need to make such extensive use of biomass,\u201d Slay told EurasiaNet.org.\nAccording to the UNDP, floods, mudslides and erosion inhibit the ability to cultivate about 50,000 hectares of land every year. This is significant for a country with less than 700,000 hectares of arable land. There is also growing danger to people and personal property. In May 2010, for instance, mudslides attributed to erosion left at least 15 dead and thousands homeless in Kulob.\n\u201cSuch reductions in ecological capital reduce the productivity of land, labor, and other resources, reducing potential economic growth and increasing poverty,\u201d Slay said.\nAlmost 70 percent of Tajiks living in rural areas use wood as their primary source of fuel, according to estimates prepared by the German government\u2019s development agency, GIZ. Tajikistan\u2019s underfunded, understaffed and undertrained employees of leskhozy, state-funded entities responsible for forest management, are struggling to combat deforestation.\n\u201cForests are important for the local economy. If you have forests you have trade in timber and non-timber forest products,\u201d said Joachim Kirchhoff, who manages the GIZ\u2019s forestry reform program in Dushanbe on behalf of Germany\u2019s Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Those skilled in forestry management are disappearing. \u201cThe low salaries do not attract young and motivated people,\u201d he said. Kirchhoff added that there are no dedicated forestry management courses at universities in Tajikistan. Most specialists still on the job were educated at Soviet institutions in Kiev and Moscow.\nIn the Gunt Valley of the remote Pamir Mountains, one ranger said he is supposed to cover 5,000 hectares, even though he lacks a vehicle. \u201cI am paid just 150 somoni [$31] per month. How can I live on that money? I have to spend some of my time working on my farm. I cannot afford to spend all my time looking after the forests,\u201d said the ranger, who was afraid he would be fired if his name appeared in print.\n\u201cI have no transport,\u201d he told EurasiaNet.org. \u201cHow can I cover such a large area?\u201d\nThe government may be slowly waking up to the problem. \u201cThe country now has a relatively modern forest law revised in August that is based on sustainable forest management,\u201d Kirchhoff said. The next step is to develop a forestry policy, which would establish mechanisms to implement the new legislation.\nDue to the lack of government funding, \u201cthere is a need for donor support and the development of a forestry management system that generates income,\u201d Kirchhoff said. GIZ is urging the government to privatize forests in the Pamirs, where farmers would be given 70 percent of the revenues from the forests in return for managing them in sustainable way.\nBut like many donor-driven initiatives in Tajikistan, it\u2019s unclear how much the government in Dushanbe is buying into the reforms. Regulations mean little in corruption-infused Tajikistan, where bureaucrats often allow personal financial interests to cloud the long-term outlook.\n\u201cIf we could find an alternative fuel, we would be happy to use it,\u201d Baburforov, the mountain villager, told EurasiaNet.org. \u201cWe understand that we are destroying our land, our home, but we have no choice as things are. We need to keep our families warm and be able to cook.\u201d\nRepost: Want to repost this article? Read the rules \u00bb\nWe would like to hear your opinion about the new site.

    "context": "What to say about ... the Bollywood Wuthering Heights musical\nWhen you first heard that Emily Bront\u00eb's brooding Victorian love story was going to be staged as a Bollywood musical by Sanjay off of EastEnders, naturally your hopes were high. No matter that the novel, according to the Guardian's Michael Billington, has already been the source for \"23 plays, 14 musicals, 16 TV and radio adaptations and eight films\". And never mind that Deepak Verma has decided to cut the vengeful second half of the book, thereby bringing his version \"closer to Mills and Boon than King Lear\" (Billington).\nWhat clearly transcended these quibbles was that, as the Times's Clive Davis puts it, \"Bront\u00eb's taste for the Gothic and Mumbai's love of melodrama ought to have made a promising match\". And after all, everybody loves a bit of Bolly, don't they? What's not to like about an incredibly long and incomprehensible Indian musical? And yet ... you can probably already guess which way this is going to go.\nWhen voicing your opinion you must, like most of the critics, demonstrate that you have really done your best to like this Wuthering Heights musical. A quick string of somewhat feeble compliments should do it. \"Kristine Landon-Smith's production makes an agreeable spectacle,\" says Billington, for instance, adding that, \"Sue Mayes's design beautifully evokes russet Rajasthan skies, and the acting is perfectly good.\"\nOr you might observe that Verma's adaptation is \"close enough to be familiar and is generally successful,\" as Ian Shuttleworth of the Financial Times does. \"A couple of the songs ... prove haunting, too,\" says Kate Bassett, piping up to fill an awkward silence in the Independent on Sunday. \"I only wish I could recommend [it] with ardency,\" shrugs the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish, without any. \"You can see how it might look good on the big screen; on stage, it feels dramatically malnourished.\"\nHaving tried to like the show, however, it is time to join the chorus of disapproval. Davis, in particular, pulls on his kicking boots. \"This half-hearted pairing [of styles] yields neither spectacle nor psychological insight,\" he thunders. \"Felix Cross and Sheema Mukherjee's lip-synched music \u2013 specially recorded in India, although you would hardly guess it \u2013 is never more than tepid. And Kristine Landon-Smith's direction delivers little of the visual energy that is the hallmark of the Bollywood industry.\" He pauses to get his breath back. And then he resumes. \"The decision to pepper the dialogue with Hindi phrases is irritating too.\" Boot. Stamp. Bludgeon. \"My Indian wife has taught me quite a few over the years, but I was still left in the dark as my neighbours chuckled away.\"\nTo avoid being mistaken for one of Davis's neighours, you might finally want to point out that if you did chuckle, it was only because you found a moment that was laugh-out-loud bad. Helpfully, Bassett has provided this example: \"'She walks across the sand, like she's floating on air,' croons the smitten Vijay,\" Bassett observes, \"even as Youkti Patel's Shakuntala hobbles out of a wheelchair, recovering from a gunshot wound to the calf. I know love is blind, but this is ridiculous.\"\nDo say: Bollywood is so marvellously vibrant and life-affirming.\nDon't say: Shouldn't this be about three hours longer?\nThe reviews reviewed: Not nearly wuthering enough.",
    "question": "What is the general opinion of critics about the Bollywood adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights?",
    "answer": "The general opinion of critics about the Bollywood adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is mixed to negative. While some critics appreciate the spectacle and a few haunting songs, many express disappointment, stating that the adaptation lacks the visual energy of the Bollywood industry, offers neither spectacle nor psychological insight, and feels dramatically malnourished on stage. The decision to include Hindi phrases in the dialogue is also criticized.",

    "context": "Rockmore International announces a new DTH hammer in its emerging Deep Hole series, the ROK 500DH. This 5 inch range hammer incorporates many new innovations and features characterized in the new Deep Hole class of DTH hammers.\nThe ROK 500DH is the first release in Rockmore's newly announced Deep Hole hammer series. As a 5 inch class hammer, the 500DH is targeted to drill 5.50 inch (140 mm) to 6.00 inch (152 mm) diameter holes. Designed to increase drilling effectiveness and efficiency in deep hole applications, the ROK 500DH incorporates engineering advancements for drilling in DTH applications such as geothermal, exploration, water-well, and in other mining and construction sectors. Unique drilling requirements in such applications often demand drilled holes exceeding 1,000 ft (300m) deep and include high volumes of water, thus presenting great challenges for conventional DTH hammers to drill effectively.\nThe ROK 500DH has been designed specifically to handle such challenges by incorporating new airflow and component design advancements, primarily in the air ports of the wear sleeve and piston. The hammer is rated for use with large compressors: 24.1 Bar (350 PSI) at 25.2 m3/min (890 SCFM), however, it can readily accept greater air volumes and pressures from larger air compressor packages. The upper and lower hammer air chambers of the 500DH have been modified accordingly in order to achieve optimum drilling efficiency. The advanced piston design also offers maximum blow energy with each stroke to the bit, allowing for superior hammer and bit penetration rates in all drilling conditions.\nA new bit retention system was also developed for this hammer in order to alleviate broken bit heads falling to the bottom of drilled holes when bit shanks fail catastrophically. A new bit shank, the DH500, was developed in conjunction with the new retention system, eliminating the need for bit retaining rings present in conventional hammer designs. The bit is retained in the driver sub by uniquely designed lobes located on the bit shoulder. If in the unlikely event that the bit breaks from the shank body during drilling operations, the bit head may be retracted out of the hole as retained by the lobes on the bit and driver sub, thus eliminating bit retrieval that is often timely and costly.\nThe traditional foot valve, or blow tube component, has also been eliminated in the DH500 shank concept. Foot valve breakages on DTH bit shanks during drilling operations are catastrophic since the hammer will cease to function immediately after such a failure. This is particularly damaging to drill time efficiency if such interruptions occur in deep hole applications, requiring the hammer to be retrieved out the hole for bit replacement. The DH500 shank alleviates such down time risk by the elimination of the foot valve component.\nConventional hammers often exhibit low penetration rates when used in deep hole applications when high water volumes exist in the hole while drilling. But due to the design advancements mentioned above, the new ROK 500DH drills exceptionally fast in dry hole conditions as well as under high water volumes exceeding 150 gal/min (9.5 lit/s) flow rates at the hole annulus. There is no compromise, therefore, in high drilling penetration rates with or without high water volumes.\nAs with all of Rockmore's DTH hammers, the 500DH take full advantage of Rockmore's patented SonicFlow technology, which optimizes airflow by simplifying and streamlining the air path to minimize backflow and turbulence, thus delivering more energy to the piston. Optional back reaming buttons on the top sub also contribute to increase hammer life. Field testing of the SonicFlow design was found to result in faster penetration rates and greater overall DTH hammer efficiency.\nThe ROK 500DH has been engineered to withstand the toughest rock drilling conditions. The solid piston design is made from an advanced material that is case hardened, combining high strength with supreme wear resistance. The high frequency, reciprocating piston is designed to strike the bit with maximum force. An innovative design, unique to Rockmore hammers, reduces the number of hammer components, thus reducing the amount of component wear points, making hammer service simpler and less expensive. Unique lead threads on the top sub and driver sub ensure easy coupling and uncoupling of the hammer.\nRockmore International is a global manufacturer of rock-drilling tools, serving the mining, construction, and water-well sectors for more than 60 years..",

And I don\u2019t want to think of how old they are now, because that means *I* am vair, vair old and need to go to an old person\u2019s home.\nThe World: We must know HOW did a person like YOU become a Gymboree teacher? Was the recruiter blind and deaf?\nMe: It\u2019s actually an interesting story. A punk girl I knew worked at Zany Brainy, which was a toy store in PA when I moved there with my ex around 10 years ago. Maybe 9. I was promised there would be no math. Anyway, there was this grand girl who we\u2019ll call Spike and she worked at Zany Brainy and got me a job there too. (we didn\u2019t have to wear khakis) and I eventually got to know the girl who ran Gymboree out of an extension of Zany Brainy. Money was tight, and the ex wasn\u2019t exactly bringing in the dough either, so I asked the girl who ran Gymboree, whom we will call Zima, if there were any job openings at Gymboree. This was back before the recession when people could actually get jobs, if you recall, there WAS such a time. As luck would have it, she was being transferred to another Gymboree and YES, she WAS looking for someone to replace her! So I took the teaching gig as a second job. This is before I lost my damn mind and COULD work, of course. I love kids, and I kinda loved Zany Brainy because if you\u2019re going to work retail, why not have it be a toy store, right? So there you go. That\u2019s how I got the job.\nThe World: People. Entrusted their children. With you.\nMe: Entirely. I was like a mama bear with those kids. I loved those kids FIERCELY. Someday I\u2019ll tell you about when I worked in a daycare. I still have DREAMS about THOSE babies.\nThe World: You and kids. Huh. That shouldn\u2019t add up, yanno. You don\u2019t exactly\u2026\nMe: \u2026fit the khakis? Yeah, I know. What can I say? I love kids.\nThe World: Well you learn something new every day. But there\u2019s one thing we must ask.\nMe: Certainly.\nThe World: The clown. The cloooooooooooooooooooown.\nMe: Gymboree\u2019s mascot is, in fact, a clown. I disliked the clown INTENSELY, but I hated the khakis more.\nThe World: Now THAT we believe.\nI had a very difficult time last year accepting that my first kindergarten class were graduating from COLLEGE that year. In fact, there were tears and more than a little muttering about \u201cnot fair\u201d and \u201cgrowing old\u201d going on.\nMary Beth (Cats, Books, Life is Good) last post: Newest Exercise Equipment \u2013 Dogs\nOK, I\u2019ve only been to Gymboree when my daughter was invited to another kid\u2019s birthday party there & I wanted to smack the overly-chipper people, and the snooty parents. Now, if YOU were the kind of person I\u2019d have at my local Gymboree, it\u2019d be worth the 30 minute drive!\nPingback: Tweets that mention C\u2019mon Everybody, It\u2019s Parachute Time! | Inverse Candlelight -- Topsy.com\ni bet you were a FANTASTIC gymboree teacher. i wish you could teach a gymboree class for my kid. the creative ones are always THE BEST and the most patient, in my experience.\nrockle last post: Hoping- Waiting- Wishing\nOh lord, my son will be 27 next month, but I still remember \u201cGymbo the Clown goes up and down, up and down, up and down\u2026\u201d\nJulia last post: On not dorking it up\nI worked at Zany Brainy in Austin, Texas. It was a blast!\nI used to demonstrate frying pans at Sears. You win!\nI can absolutely believe you worked at Gymboree and loved it.\n: )\nColleen last post: We came to some conclusions today",

    "context": "The Canadian Museum of History may be known to some as the Canadian Museum of Civilization. Times change; names change; history does not change; but the interpretation of the history can change with every perspective each human can imagine.\nThe Canadian Museum of History has an amazing website where you can learn all about the structure, where from 1983 to 1989, it began to take shape. I highly recommend taking the time to view the Slide Show, Video Clips ~ streaming Video, Quick Time Movies,, a Full Tour and more; truly an experience in itself. Another great place to start is to view their Full-Colour Visitor Guide. It will assist with guiding you to the main points of interest.\nThe Museum attracts over 1.2 million visitors, so you can imagine that it makes it the country\u2019s most-visited museum. It is a highly respected centre, sharing its history, archaeology, ethnology and cultural studies to visitors from around the world. The Museum houses the Canadian Children\u2019s Museum and an IMAX\u00ae Theatre. Today a large group of students enthusiastically joined in a line-up waiting to take their turn in the Theatre, the noise was high with excitement, then quite ensued, leaving us in a peaceful state to start our Tour.\nThe Museum allows visitors to discover exhibitions, rich with information, artifacts and exciting experiences. Today we were fortunate to tour the Museum with our guide Michel. He has been with this Museum for 5 years, but previously has had a lot of experience with other organizations. Michel insisted that we start the tour outside. Here you will see that the architecture has been designed to look like a mask.\nOn the walls outside the Museum, we saw, The St. Lawrence Seaway cut through the Canadian Shield forming the \u201cstrata\u201d. You can actually see the layers of limestone. If you have ever been caving or even rock climbing, you will recognize the magnificent natural work of art. The design represents the Plains and the water cascading made to represent ice melting. What better place to start.\nThere are over 4 million artifacts and specimens, being housed in the Museum archives. Acquisitions of Canadian heritage are received via donations or bequest, but there are distinct conditions for acceptance. The new acquisitions can bring a new perspective to the existing collection and they can be use for research. Michel tells us these artifacts are unparalleled anywhere in the world. He also mentioned that they are at the point where the CMH is looking for rare items, ones they don\u2019t already have and considerations to see if there is a \u201cfit\u201d for their research. You can check out their website for more details if you are interested.\nThe Artifacts in the Museum are strategically placed in the telling of a story. On the second level, the three galleries are devoted to changing exhibitions. Some are designed by the CMH, while others may be presented by other International Institutions. The museum includes the Canadian Children\u2019s Museum and an IMAX\u00ae Theatre. Unfortunately we did not have time to check out either on this visit. Michel tells us the Museum offers a passport to learn from a child\u2019s perspective.\nBefore we started, here are some points of interest that Michel mentioned. The Museum is \u201cmobility impaired\u201d compatible. That means that folks with any walking issues can still get around the Museum. Elevators are available to assist with transition from level to level. The washrooms and parking are mobility friendly also.\nAs we stood at the main entrance inside, a lower level welcomed us to \u201cThe Grand Hall\u201d, a newly renovated Northwest Coast permanent exhibition of a 1900 century village. This area explores the rich and vibrant culture of the Canada\u2019s First Peoples. It represents their histories, cultural identities, artistic expressions and traditional and contemporary ways of life. High above the ceiling looks like a dug out canoe. The walls, if you look closely, resemble large canoe paddles. The granite floor represents a body of water. This exhibit was created with collaboration with the University of British Columbia and the Native Peoples. It was very important when developing this exhibit that \u201ctheir voice\u201d was heard.\nThe artifacts long like does our many Ontario.\nOur Tour Guide goes on to say that this Museum is about Canada are embraced with a re-enactment of the natural environment of the Villages being displayed; from the covered ceilings in tree foliage to the Yukon is 24,000 years old. A mammoth leg bone is the oldest artifact in the Museum. The Museum uses areas that create a story. LeFemme du Ciel and Gloscap is depicted high above dropping from the ceiling. discussed with Michel what we were looking and at what it represented. In part, Michel said it represented the sacrifices that people made to have a better life, they fought for their freedom. Part of the wonderful opportunity in the Region was the natural resources and the ability to fish, whale resources, fur, timber trade and such.\nFrom the First Nation Exhibits, we were fully immerged in our journey through Canada Hall, all 17 meter high ceilings and a full football field in length. Our timing was perfect to Tour today as this Exhibition will be closed while they create a new Canadian History Hall.\nThe following is just a \"taste\" of Canadian History Hall. As we travelled along, we came across the period of time when wagons were introduced into our lives. Gary, being a McWilliams, has ancestors in Lakefield, Ontario, where his ancestors were the local carriage maker. Our guide seemed to be intently listening to Gary\u2019s story. This is when he told us that the Museum tells \u201cour story\u201d, that your ancestors are here, this is the story of your grandfather, his father and so on. I felt a great connection being there.\nWe travelled through the Railway where we were told this may be the most important stop, from 1867-1923, were it is said \u201clets go west my son\u201d. And travel became a possibility, a reality. The multicultural country church in the Museum is an original artifact from Alberta. A Chinese hand laundry building is displayed. Many components of the Museum reflect the plight of the people in Canada and their journey through time., that much more..\nThat\u2019s what we plan on doing, getting a full feast of Canadian History, what an incredible journey, what an amazing Tour.",

    "context": "BALTIMORE, Oct. 14, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- MMA Capital Management, LLC (NASDAQ: MMAC) (\"MMA Capital\" or the \"Company\"), a Delaware limited liability company, today announced that the Company has entered into a series of transactions with Morrison Grove Management, LLC (\"Morrison Grove\"), related to the Company's low-income housing tax credit (\"LIHTC) funds (\"TCE\") for the purposes of providing short and long-term economic benefits to the Company and enhancing performance for investors in the funds. Morrison Grove, a business owned and operated, in part, by the Company's former Chief Operating Officer, Charles M. Pinckney, has acquired TCE and combined it with the existing LIHTC business run by Morrison Grove. The Company also provided additional financing to Morrison Grove to fund the redemption of certain of the ownership interests in the legacy Morrison Grove tax credit equity business, and entered into an option to purchase the combined business beginning in five years.\nMichael Falcone, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, \"This transaction achieves our goals of creating economies of scale, increasing cash flows and preserving long-term opportunities from the tax credit equity business. It creates immediate economic value for us because it converts the uncertain timing of cash flows associated with the TCE business into cash flows from a secured lending, which both accelerates and provides predictable timing of future cash flows. Through the purchase option we are able to preserve and provide for the potential long-term upside in the residual management fees from a larger tax credit equity business, potentially providing a path for significant future income. And finally, we are able to free up the intellectual capital of our senior leaders to focus on our leveraged bond business, legacy assets and strategic opportunities in the US. This transaction also allows the Company to partner once again with the principals of Morrison Grove, Charles Pinckney and Mark Johnson, both former employees of MMA Capital. Charlie and Mark are trusted business partners and we firmly believe they will enhance the value of the combined tax credit equity business.\"\nFor Morrison Grove, the acquisition of TCE, when combined with its own legacy LIHTC business, provides a significantly larger asset base that leverages its existing management business and real estate expertise. The combined enterprise has approximately $1.5 billion in equity invested, collateralized by 305 multifamily housing properties, across 44 LIHTC funds which mature between now and 2025. Mr. Pinckney, Chief Executive Officer of Morrison Grove, stated, \"With the combination of our existing management platform and the ability to generate economies of scale we see a tremendous opportunity to strengthen our management business today and in the future. In addition, I am very excited that Morrison Grove and MMA Capital will be closely aligned going forward. We believe there are meaningful opportunities to add value for investors in our funds and shareholders of both companies and we look forward to working hard to realize those opportunities.\"\nAt the time of sale, TCE was comprised of the general partner and manager interests and asset management rights in 11 guaranteed LIHTC funds and two non\u2011guaranteed LIHTC funds. The Company retained its ownership interests in the two non-guaranteed funds. The TCE sales price of $15.9 million was entirely seller financed through a $17.3 million senior loan and a $13.0 million subordinate loan, resulting in an overall reduction to cash of $14.4 million. This cash was used to finance the redemption of certain ownership interests in Morrison Grove. The $17.3 million senior loan is designed as bridge financing that matures at December 31, 2014, subject to extension, and bears an interest rate of 10%. The $13.0 subordinate loan matures on September 30, 2024, bears an interest rate of 12%, including 8% current pay and 4% deferred. Both loans are secured by the interests in the combined Morrison Grove LIHTC management business and are pre-payable at any time. In addition, the Company entered into an option to acquire the combined Morrison Grove LIHTC management business with an option period beginning October 1, 2019 and expiring on September 30, 2024. For more details on the terms of the transactions, please see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2014.\nPrimarily because the Company retained its investor yield guarantee and the $15.0 million of cash pledged towards that obligation with respect the Company's guaranteed LIHTC funds, the Company will not be able to achieve sale accounting and will therefore defer a GAAP gain of $15.8 million on the transaction. Historically, and at the date of this transaction, the Company estimated the guarantee exposure at zero.: INTEGRITY. INNOVATION. SERVICE.\nSOURCE MMA Capital Management, LLC",

The disc mires down in metallic grunge for most of its play, thanks to abrasive tracks from the Deftones, Stutterfly, Disturbed and an early Marilyn Manson song (before he realized that loud could also be catchy). The best track on the disc is the salaciously sigh-heavy \"Cut Me Up,\" by popsters Har Mar Superstar. Also included are songs from the Prodigy, My Chemical Romance, Bloodsimple, the Von Bondies, and old tracks from the Stooges and the Joy Division.\nOn the racks also is the mostly symphonic soundtrack to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy film from Hollywood Records. The disc includes a mix of movie dialogue snippets, upbeat and often humorously sci-fi orchestral score, musical show tunes and gospel R&B, thanks to Betty Wright and Al Green.\nIf you're looking for oldies, there are a host of \"best of\" collections out this month. Reprise has just released former Replacements singer Paul Westerberg's Besterberg: The Best of Paul Westerberg. The CD offers 20 tracks, led off by his biggest hit, \"Dyslexic Heart,\" and includes a couple of previously unreleased songs.\nWarner Music's Totally Hits series now offers the CD collection Totally Hits 2005, featuring 20 recent singles from Kelly Clarkson, Gavin DeGraw, Alicia Keys, Maroon 5, Ryan Cabrera, Avril Lavigne, Tweet and more.\nColumbia's Legacy label has just unearthed a healthy dose of pop nostalgia with a bunch of \"best of\" sets and Essential collections. The 35th anniversary edition of Come On Get Happy! The Very Best of the Partridge Family features a young David Cassidy leading the TV show \"family\" on classic recordings of \"Come On Get Happy\" and \"I Think I Love You,\" as well as a handful of never-before-released-on-CD songs (17 tracks in all).\nAnother pop heartthrob, Rick Springfield, is represented on a two-CD set Written in Rock, the Rick Springfield Anthology. Covering 35 years of recordings (who knew he was that old?) the collection features his early cover of \"Eleanor Rigby,\" his moderate '70s hits \"American Girls\" and \"Speak to the Sky,\" as well as his massive '80s hits \"Jessie's Girl,\" \"I've Done Everything for You,\" \"Love Somebody,\" \"Human Touch,\" and \"Don't Talk to Strangers.\"\nLegacy has four new entries in its \"The Essential ...\" series of artist collection CDs, featuring classic '60s folk and '70s rock material from Pete Seeger, Dion, Poco and Jefferson Airplane. The discs feature classics such as Seeger's \"This Land Is Your Land,\" Dion's \"The Wanderer\" and \"Runaround Sue,\" Jefferson Airplane's \"Somebody to Love\" and White Rabbit\" and Poco's \"Pickin' Up the Pieces.\"\nNew Order\nWaiting for the Siren's Call\n(Warner Bros.)\nThe premier British alternative pop-dance band is back for the first time in four years, and returns with one of its strongest releases ever.\nWaiting for the Siren's Call offers a dozen upbeat tracks that celebrate Peter Hook's twining, trademark reverberating basslines and Bernard Sumner's casually smooth vocals.\nFrom the keyboard slaloms of the mellowly urgent title track, to the sing-song hit hooks of \"Hey Now What You Doing,\" and the throbbing techno-bassline and bell-tone keys of the disc's first single, \"Krafty,\" which harks back to the days of the \"Brotherhood\" album, this CD is a sonic victory for New Order.\nAll of the musical strings they've unraveled in the past are wound together here, making Waiting for the Siren's Call a seamless experience from start to finish. Put this disc on and you'll be lured into the expansive world of delicious sound that only New Order can craft.\nThis is the first time Phil Cunningham, who was recruited to step in for Gillian Gilbert on their last tour, worked with the band on songwriting, something that may worry New Order purists. But the results are top-notch New Order. Gilbert had to leave the band a few years ago to care for her and drummer Stephen Morris' children, and apparently the leave of absence has become permanent.\nWhile their last disc lacked a solid dance floor hit, Waiting for the Siren's Call has both jamming techno-rock tracks in \"Who's Joe\" and \"Dracula's Castle,\" warm, kaleidescopic guitar flourishes in \"Turn,\" as well as mixable hits such as \"Krafty,\" \"Guilt Is a Useless Emotion\" and \"Jetstream,\" a slowly pumping techno anthem that features Ana Matronic, from Scissor Sister, joining Sumner on vocals.\nThere are no filler tracks on Siren's Call; and the band apparently had such a productive writing session for the album that its press release claims it has enough extra tracks to fill in the bulk of another CD. From the throbbing stack of potential hits on this disc, it seems that the band may be starting yet another golden creative chapter in the long history of New Order.",

Information and opinion are special goods, inherent to the conditions of life in society. For that reason journalists are responsible not only to editors but also to society for the information and opinions that they transmit. For this:\n(a) They assume responsibility to interpret the truth, make it clear in order to make sure that people from the social sectors comprehend.\n(b) They procure the co-existence of democracy justly and harmoniously with respect to human rights, fighting against all forms of corruption.\n(c) Contribute their knowledge and capacity to defend the nature of things and balance the systems of that which life operates.\n2. In their professional work journalist must contribute to principles, to the truth and to equanimity and will break professional ethics when they stay silent, falsify or distort the facts. They should supply the public with elements of context pertaining to the matter, together with different aspects of the subject so that the recipient of the material can interpret for themselves the origins and perspective of the facts.\n3. In divulging ideas and opinions, journalists should promote the creation of conditions in order to express themselves democratically and not be restricted by commercial interest, publicity, or other influences.\n4. Journalists are responsible for their information and opinions. They will accept the right to retort and respect the professional secrets relating to the source of information.\n5. Offensive actions to professional ethics:\n* Plagiarism and loss of respect to intellectual property\n* Acceptance of back-handers, bribery or extortion\n* Omission of information of collective interest\n* Defamation, slander, damaging insult\n* Sensationalism\n* To play a part in any form of persecution or social, political, religious, racial or sexual discrimination\n6. Journalists and society.\nThe character of the profession demands that journalists accept and promote the circulation of ideas and opinions so that they contribute to the building of a pluralistic and participatory society. On the same lines they should participate and collaborate with different social sectors, especially minorities, so their voices are heard through these mediums of information.\n7. Journalists should always maintain respect and dignity to people\u2019s private lives. Avoiding being tempted by the possibility of invading one\u2019s intimacy offered by reasons of new technological advances.\nFor this they will be guided by law and the internationally recognised tools of their trade. The exception to the rule of divulgence of private acts is permitted, for reasons of public sanctions, the necessity to shield the integrity of civil servants or when in private one\u2019s physical or psychological rights are violated.\n8. Journalists must safeguard the innocence of the accused until the courts have passed sentence. At the same time they should abstain from identifying victims of sexual crimes whatever their age or social condition without their consent. The same applies to minors that might have participated in a crime.\n9. Journalists should actively contribute to public health and defend the ecological balance necessary to human life and they should report events that are responsible for contamination and destruction of the environment.\n10. Journalists should promote cultural values and national identity without chauvinism. Special interest should be demonstrated in the valuable use of \u201cGuarani\u201d and \u201cJopar\u00e1\u201d (translation of these terms unknown).\n11. Journalists and their equals.\nJournalists should strengthen the organisations and the syndicate union association, and should contribute to create them wherever they do not exist, and they should join the country\u2019s labour movement.\n12. Journalists should always be in solidarity with their colleagues, especially with the ones who suffer persecution or aggression caused by their professional work.\n13. A journalist is especially forbidden to discredit fellow journalists, either by personal disqualification or professional discredit.\n14. Journalists and commercial enterprises.\nJournalists are united to companies by obligations derived from work contracts. Journalists will try to make contracts in a collective manner and to welcome union decisions. At the same time they will be responsible for their work, respecting these code ethics, the duties pointed out in the national constitution and the republic laws of Paraguay.\n15. Journalists must demand from the companies respect for their beliefs, ideas and opinions, together with material that they submit as a product of their work. They shall not let the companies change the meaning of the information materials handed in under their own signature.\n16. Journalists will assume together with the companies the responsibility that all information gathered by them shall be circulated without any alteration against the wishes of the editor. Journalists have the right to withdraw their signature from any information if they consider it not to be exact, an incorrect declaration of a third party, or if substantial changes were made unjustly.\n17. Journalists should fight to obtain the right to control the execution and manufacture of the informative and editorial politics in the medium in which they work.\n18. Journalists must claim their right to express their points of view in the \u201cOpinion Section\u201d in the medium in which they work, even when their ideas do not coincide with the company\u2019s editorial politics.\n19. Journalists must demand from their company the right treatment according to their human dignity. Also, they must demand recognition of the importance and value of their job in society.\n20. It is clear that the simultaneous practice of journalism and publicity are incompatible. Journalists should always achieve a rigorous and formal distinction between information and publicity in order not to induce the receiver to error or confusion.",

    "context": "Old age is a very serious disease that can be cured with conservative methods\nWithin the whole of its history, mankind is pondering over a problem that is topical in all epochs. Can old age be defeated and how if possible? More and more scientists now say they have neared creation of a remedy to defeat death. Candidate of historical sciences Lyudmila Orekhova, senior research assistant with the State Historical Museum says that mankind's struggle against death has lasted for many years. Antique scientists and medieval alchemists, doctors and sorcerers, kings and men of the common people sought for eternal life. In Ancient Rome, spectators rushed to the arena as soon as gladiators' fights were over to wash with the blood of the defeated. Drinking of blood of new-born babies was considered a more radical method to get immortal. There are many \"secret\" longevity formulas developed in different centuries, some of them are over 4,000 years old. For example, it was believed in the old times that a man should dry up 600 spiders, 300 bats and 99 toads, pound them, make a drink of the mixture and drink it on a fool moon night. At that, it was very important that toads must be 100 years old. The recipe said that if a man woke up alive next morning after drinking the beverage, he was promised a long unclouded life. The formula allowed drinking the beverage several times, but each time the number of disgusting creatures required for grinding increased three times.\nAn old Persian manuscript recommended the following method: \"To become immortal, take a red-haired freckled man and feed him with fruit until he reaches the age of 30. Then put him into a brass vessel filled with honey and herbs, bind the vessel with gold hoops and seal hermetically.\" The author of the manuscript says that the body of the freckled man will turn into a mummy in 120 years. It was recommended to eat the contents of the vessel in small portions every day, which was said to be a guarantee to prolong the life for 300-500 years.\nNowadays, mankind is preoccupied with the idea of immortality not less than people used to be in the old times. In the early 1920s, specialists who were called juvenologists tried to prolong men's youth and implanted genital glands of macaque to them. Swedish scientist Peter Niegans suggested injecting serum made of a new-born fallow-deer's tissues. Gerontologists from Moscow's 2nd Medical Institute held an experiment in 1975 that made the life of test mice last twice as long with the help of queen bee's milk. However, neither those methods nor autotransfusion (re-infusion of blood shed from surgery or trauma) produced any sensational results. It seemed at that time that old age was invincible. However, more sensations concerning life prolongation have emerged at the threshold of the century.\nAmerican Doctors of Medicine Write and Shown from the University of Cleveland declared two years ago that they had discovered clockwork responsible for life and death on the cell level. The Discovery popular scientific magazine reported that the scientists had discovered a ferment called telomeraza that could make human cells never stop the division and constantly rejuvenate. It was said that if telomeraza was synthesized artificially, human life could last endlessly. Unfortunately, the sensation failed in several months: \"ever young\" test mice fell ill with cancer in 2-3 months and died.\nDoctor of biological science Alexander Dubrov, the leading research assistant from the Institute of Ecology and Evolution Problems of Russia's Academy of Sciences explains: \"Hormones became the next step on the way toward longevity. They strengthen bones and muscles, smooth the skin; others, melatonin for example, prolong the life cycles.\"\nItalian biologists held a number of experiments with mice that became slenderer and livelier as a result of the experiment. But the test mice died in half a year. At that very moment, Russian scientists came up to the scene. Doctor of Biology Sciences Lyudmila Obukhova from the Biochemical Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences says that at the beginning of the year some colleagues of hers have managed to find immortal cells of the conjunctive tissue; this may prolong the human life at least 2-3 times in the future. Unlike western scientists, Russian specialists stake on antioxidants, the substance reducing the activity of oxidation processes in the human body. They are the main cause of ageing. It is too early to speak about any results of experiments held in this connection: experiments on mice and rats were started just several months ago. But Lyudmila Obukhova says that scientists are nevertheless full of optimism.\nIt would take much space and time to speak about all methods declared as effective against ageing. Scientists from the Siberian department of Russia's Academy of Sciences offered to bomb the human organism with artificially synthesized macrofag cells, those ones that are responsible for renovation of cells. Doesn't it make more sense to save not the body but human brain and information it contains? It is this information that determines people's personality. Attempts to immortalize a personality by placing of \"intellect\" into special reservoirs are carried out in the Brain Institute of Russia's Academy of Sciences.\nRecently, famous neurosurgeon Professor Gerhard von Klike published results of his talks with competent scientists and pronounced a death sentence to death. In his words, old age is a serious disease that can be cured with conservative methods. Intervention into the human genetic apparatus will soon allow prolonging the life limits considerably. The next generation, he says, may expect to live 150-160 years of normal life, and their descendants may live even 1.5-2 times longer. According to the estimates of the British Future Foundation Director, Biology Professor Anthony Grayham, \"the pension age of people will be 80-90 years in 30-35 years; after that, people will have about 60 years of active life more.\" He says that the life chronology will seriously change: people will be able to get not 1-2 educations, but 5-6 ones within their lifetime; he says it will be possible to change workplaces every two or three years; marriages will be possible every 5-6 years. On the whole, scientists say that the institution of marriage will gradually become obsolete: they say that people of the future will prefer to freely cohabitate with each other which will allow them to change lovers in all ages, 40 or 70. Scientists admit it will be possible on condition that people will be forever young. Children will come to this world only as a result of artificial insemination. But is it the longevity we have been dreaming of?\nNatalia Leskova",

The deadline for filing claims with the county is Thursday \u2014 the six-month anniversary of the attack.

The company said it has already spent more than $23,000 in connection with workers\u2019 compensation claims made by five IRC employees and expects additional expenses.\nCounty spokesman David Wert responded with the same statement he has made when other claims were filed: \u201cThe county will carefully consider each claim and act in the best interests of everyone involved.\u201d\nRepublic Indemnity alleges that San Bernardino County was negligent in not providing adequate security at the Dec. 2 gathering at which county health inspector Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, fatally shot 14 people and wounded 22 others in what the FBI declared the deadliest terrorist act on U.S. soil since 9/11.\n\u201cClaimant is further informed and believes that the County of San Bernardino knew, or should have known, that its employee, Syed Rizwan Farook, had engaged in adversarial and argumentative conduct with his co-employees, and as such, posed a reasonably foreseeable danger to those persons in close proximity to the holiday party,\u201d the claim states.\nThe company further alleges that the county negligently hired and trained Farook, and that Farook\u2019s violent intentions should have been apparent once the party began.\n\u201cThe County of San Bernardino failed to perform an adequate background check of Syed Rizwan Farook and further failed to intervene to protect persons in their employ, as well as persons in close proximity to where this holiday party took place once it was determined that Syed Rizwan Farook had become a disgruntled, unhappy, and violent employee as said holiday party progressed,\u201d the company alleges in a two-page attachment to the claim form.\nOrtiz and Sandefur each wrote a few sentences.\n\u201cThe county breached its duty to provide a safe work environment for its employees and visitors, in all aspects,\u201d Sandefur\u2019s claim says in part. \u201cThe county also breached its duty to hire and retain workers who, working under the color of authority of the county, are not a danger to others.\u201d",

    "context": "Since the United States is a fairly dynamic place economically and socially, there are obviously multiple tiers to any discussion of its migration patterns. To simplify, since we know that Hispanic immigrants are on the rise, let\u2019s look at it two ways, with help from The Atlantic Cities.\nFirst, there\u2019s net domestic migration. That means, essentially, areas within the U.S. that people are leaving, and subsequent areas that people move to:\nAs you can see on that map, people are actually leaving the three largest metro areas in America \u2014 NYC, Chicago and Los Angeles \u2014 and predominantly heading to Dallas, Houston, Seattle, the Carolinas, Nashville (a big block there), and central (but not necessarily southern) Florida. This is happening for a lot of reasons \u2014 one notable one is cost, and another one is the idea that social/economic mobility might be better away from the coastal cities. There\u2019s also the idea of where to find the best talent, which for some industries might be NYC (finance) or SF (tech), but for many mid-size and small companies might be in-the-middle-college-towns (like a Madison, or a Tucson).\nNow check out net international migration, i.e. where people are settling when they come to the U.S. from abroad:\nThat\u2019s pretty much the reverse picture of the first map \u2014 the Northeast corridor is such a huge positive bubble it looks like it might explode, and Miami is similar (most people who choose to disparage Miami will say it\u2019s \u201cnot really part of the U.S.;\u201d my in-laws live there and while I enjoy it, there is some kernel of truth in that statement, for sure). Dallas and Houston are also big on the international map (makes sense, as Houston has wide swaths of Spanish-speaking communities), so this all leads you to net total migration:\nIn this picture, the coasts are still getting an influx of people \u2014 especially the south Florida area \u2014 but you also see insane growth in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Denver, and Phoenix-down-to-Tucson. Austin and most of that Texas energy wealth/corridor makes sense; that\u2019s been documented for a little bit now. Denver and Fort Collins, etc. have some of the highest quality-of-life scores in America, so that makes sense too. People seem to generally be moving away from the Midwest/Rust Belt/parts of the Southeast; that\u2019s been documented too.\nIs there a broader lesson here? Probably not on an individual level, since people\u2019s decisions about where they live tend to be extremely personal (and obviously tied to spouse/family considerations as well). From a business perspective, sure, there\u2019s some \u2014 putting an upstart company in Denver, Nashville, Boise, or Dallas right now could be beneficial (and there\u2019s varying degrees of cost associated with land in those places) \u2014 although in general, most people move around to what they know (or have some context with). I\u2019ve met probably 500 people in my life who have moved, and only 2 of those were moving to a place they had never been before the move. You may see a shift in \u201crandom moves\u201d as the millennial generation becomes a bigger part of the earning-money workforce, but still, people tend to go where (a) a good job, (b) their family or (c) their friends are, and not often to a random fourth place.\nRemember also: the data above doesn\u2019t say anything about where in an area people are moving. There can be a huge cluster around Dallas, but does that mean suburbs, city center, Fort Worth, etc? The land associated with what people construe as \u201cHouston\u201d is massive \u2014 are more people moving to Sugarland? Does that count Galveston? Etc, etc. So there\u2019s some context missing from this picture, but it still provides an overall view of what people are doing when they move in the US, to the US, or generally around the US.",

They protect you and teach you, create things for you. They help you and mentor you. They are varied. They are diverse. They are important.\nThey are people you might see every day.\nAnd they are people we might see every day in the course of providing care and treatment for individuals and families impacted by eating disorders.\nAt The Center for Eating Disorders at Sheppard Pratt, we see numerous people each day struggling with anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, ARFID and other feeding and eating disorders. These individuals with eating disorders are varied. They are diverse. They are important.\nThis is why we were proud to participate in the inaugural March Against Eating Disorders on Capitol Hill last fall and why we are eager to return this year on October 27th for an even larger and more impactful event. As physicians, therapists, dietitians and nurses specializing in the treatment of people with eating disorders, we see the daily struggle, the medical repercussions, the fear and the impact of eating disorders on relationships, careers and families. But we also see the hope, the healing and comfort that comes with treatment and recovery. That is why it\u2019s so important for those of us in the field to stand up and share our voices too.\nWhy do we march?\n- We march because eating disorders continue to be stigmatized, sensationalized, overlooked and underfunded despite having the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.\n- We march because no one chooses to have an eating disorder. Eating disorders are highly heritable illnesses, meaning 50-80% of a person\u2019s risk for developing an eating disorder is genetic. Additional causes are varied and complex.\n- We march because no family should hear \u201cit\u2019s just a phase, she\u2019ll grow out of it.\u201d from a medical professional before they make it through our doors. A lack of specialized eating disorder training for physicians delays detection and appropriate referrals. Delaying treatment delays recovery.\n- We march because 20-30% of our patients are men who thought they were the \u201conly one\u201d and suffered in silence for a long time. Eating disorders don\u2019t discriminate and treatment shouldn\u2019t either.\n- We march because parents do not cause eating disorders but eating disorders can cause heartache for parents and family members. Guilt, blame, stigma and outdated stereotypes can prevent families from getting the help they deserve. Current research supports an understanding that caregivers can play a positive and integral role in helping a loved one to heal from their eating disorder.\n- We march because eating disorders can be deadly but they can also be overcome. Early intervention and evidence-based treatment makes a difference.\n- We march because no one should have to get sicker before they can get well. Insurance coverage for eating disorders must not be a barrier to quality care.\n- We march because we live together in a culture that equates weight loss with health, yet we work every day with individuals whose weight loss is associated with osteopenia, hair loss, fatigue, cardiac arrhythmia and infertility. We support a movement that embraces health-focused goals for our schools and communities instead of weight-focused goals.\nThese are just some of the reasons why we are excited to stand with The Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness, The Eating Disorder Coalition, and MAED \u2013 Mothers Against Eating Disorders at The #MarchAgainstED in our nation\u2019s capitol. Join us on October 27th to take a stand and help increase awareness about eating disorders.\nWhy will you march?\nRegister now at\n* * *\nWritten by Kate Clemmer, LCSW-C, Community Outreach Coordinator at The Center for Eating Disorders at Sheppard Pratt for\nThe original posting of this blog is available at:",

    "context": "So recently I \u201chad to\u201d add some new social networks to my growing list of accounts (e.g. this one) and it again started to annoy me quite a bit.\nSo what is wrong?\nBasically I think it\u2019s the fact that all those social networks out there (or at least most) are very much walled gardens. They surely give me all sorts of interaction possibilities with my friends and contacts but it\u2019s all happening just on their site.\nThey model my social graph for me but it\u2019s hidden on their site.\nThe let my friends send me messages but those are hidden on their site (although we have a quite well working messaging system called email. Why not at least include the message body in that email).\nThe let me write applications for their site but they again are hidden on their site and not portable anyway (might change with OpenSocial).\nThe have all my data but it\u2019s hidden on their site.\nSo all of this is sort of annoying me plus the fact that nearly none of those sites utilize useful things like OpenID (IIRC some Ning representative at the AlwaysOn conference said that users don\u2019t want OpenID. Hello?)\nSo what is the future here? I think I am getting more and more lazy with each new social network which wants my data. I might not try to find my friends anymore, I might not try to interact much with it beside that what might be very much useful for me.\nI might not even respond to messages anymore because I might happen to have forgotten my password for this one and I am too lazy to go through that email process (which email was it again? Which was actually my account name?!?)\nAs long as you are not the top ten of those sites that\u2019s probably bad for you.\nSo social networks need to open up. They need to give me my data back and might subscribe to my already existing data like my social graph which might be stored where I like it. That way those networks will get much more useful data.\nOne problem is of course also the advertising model most of the sites use. This of course is a main driving force for walled gardens. So it might be interesting to see if the open source community will come up with something better. There are already good attempts like NoseRub or even OpenID (maybe not open source but open standards).\nThen there are also attempts on making virtual worlds more interoperable and from what I see so far esp. in the Second Life Grid Architecture Working Group is also promising for social networks in general. They think ahead of how to define identity in a more global way. Of course we have to see how much is left when the protocols are finished and of course many of the existing virtual worlds (actually all) are also walled gardens. But maybe there is hope \ud83d\ude42\nSo what do you think about the future of social networks regarding openness? Will you have a future where virtual worlds will be part of that and where you have to define an avatar additionally to friends, groups and profile on every single website you want to visit or do you think you can reuse existing information and actually control it?\nTags: socialnetworks, web2.0, openid, standards, open, open, open, rant\nYou already mentioned NoseRub and I strongly believe in that approach: the user controls and defines his/her social network \u2013 if they want, on their own servers and they only allow service providers like flickr (providing image storage) and youtube (providing video storage) to access this social network.\nBut the user is the center of all that and ot the dozens of social networks out there which main feature is the social network itself: who knows whom. Nobody needs that at more than one place and mostly I want to have control over it.\nI attended your talk at Barcamp Cologne only partly and only partly looked at NoseRub itself (is the protocol itself actually documented somewhere) but from what I saw it looked very promising.\nOf course it cannot solve all the problems because after all those services are walled gardens mostly. So I\u2019d like to see some standard for messaging, for authentication, for managing my friends list and so on.\nWhere NoseRub is good in reading and keeping stuff up to date I\u2019d also would like something which actually can write to these services (e.g. push my most recent social graph to them). And having a social graph in a central place would of course also help services like NoseRub to automate more stuff.\nBTW, will you be at the Barcamp Berlin?\nYes, I will be at BarCamp Berlin and will do a session about NoseRub.\nUnfortuanetly, there is currenty no written \u201cprotocol\u201d. I hope we can fix this real soon, so that people could write their NoseRub services in Ruby, Perl, Pyth, etc..\nI think that pushing your social graph to a plattform would not be neccessary. Flickr does not need to know, that A and B are contacts. You need to know that and the privacy mechanism needs to know that, so A can determine, wether B should be able to access his/her photos.\nThis would be the ultimate goal.",

It is also known by the name of . The market and demand for shell pearls however, is still consistent as it is used consistently by jewelers world wide.\nThe creation of a shell bead takes several steps, all of which are man-made processes. These processes are important as they determine the final look and quality the shell pearl will have when it is ready for public usage. This process starts from various specialized mother of pearl sea beds and artificial pools where oysters and mollusks grow in abundance and in good health and form. This provides a stable and consistent source of high quality shells that will be used for the creation of the shell bead. These shell farms also produce actual pearls.\nThe Creation of a Shell Pearl\nOnce the shells are cultivated from the water farms, these shells are brought into processing in order to make Shell Pearls. The first step begins with selecting good shells from which pearls will be made from. The shells are cut into strips that can be easily cut by machine and formed into small spheres. These spheres are rough and unpolished, and have to be manually shaped by hand to achieve a better, more beautiful shape. After the shell is turned into beads, the beads are checked for quality and are machine drilled with tiny holes that will be used to string the beads together.\nStringing the beads together is done by hand. These strung beads are then framed and stored for final processing. The framing of the beads is done by connecting the ends of strings into a large frame. The result is a frame of several strings of beads aligned parallel to each other. These shell pearl beads are then coated with dyes; this is how colored beads are made. To perfect the coating of the dye, the shell pearls are brought into a large oven where they will be baked. This step not only creates a good coat of dye, but also tempers the consistency and toughness of the bead.\nSteps before Releasing the Shell Pearls\nAfter baking the shell pearls, they are removed from the frames and the strings for the last finishing touches. The first finishing touch is polishing. Polishing involves removing excess dye and creating a good and consistent glossy finish throughout the bead. This is done by machine. After polishing, the pearls are then sent to the last quality control phase where they are inspected for any flaws. Those that pass are then sorted according to color and size. Once they are sorted, the pearls are packed and are sent to suppliers across the globe.\nFor more information on sequin acrylic beads or to purchase them online visit neon acrylic beads today!\nLes commentaires sont ferm\u00e9s.",

    "context": "Posted on 28.11.17 by Samantha Eaton\nWhen you buy a property there are many factors to consider \u2013 price, location, transport links, local schools, crime stats, what there is to do in the local area etc. depending on your requirements the list is potentially endless. However, few of these factors are as important as whether the property you\u2019re purchasing is leasehold or freehold.\nMany buyers, particularly first time buyers, can\u2019t be blamed for thinking that when you buy a property, it is then yours to do with as you please. Unfortunately it\u2019s not quite that simple. Whether you own the freehold or just the leasehold will affect your rights over the property.\nFreehold Vs Leasehold\nThe fundamental difference between freehold and leasehold is that with a freehold property, you have outright ownership of the property and the land on which it stands. Whole houses are usually sold freehold whereas flats are often leasehold. Leasehold is a bit more complicated. If you own a leasehold property, you have a lease to live there for a certain number of years (anywhere up to 999 years) but someone else (commonly referred to as the \u2018landlord\u2019) owns the freehold.\nTypically, freehold is always preferred as there is very little downside. As the freeholder, you have sole responsibility for maintaining the fabric of the building (walls and roof). You also have the freedom of not having to gain permission from the freeholder (often referred to as the \u2018landlord\u2019) if you want to make alterations to the property (such as adding a conservatory or extension). You also have the added bonus of not having to pay service charges and/or annual ground rent or to the freeholder.\nWith a leasehold property, you will pay an annual ground rent to the freeholder, you will normally have to get permission to undertake any major works or alterations to the property. Depending on the terms of the lease, there may also be other restrictions such as no pets or subletting. Failure to fulfil terms of the lease could lead to it becoming forfeit.\nDeclining Value of Leaseholds\nThere is more to consider when buying a leasehold property. First and foremost, it\u2019s important to check the length of the lease as anything less than 80 years can significantly affect the value of your property.\nIf it\u2019s a long lease the value of your property will be stable, but as the lease gets shorter, the leasehold property will reduce in value. The reduction will be minor at first but as the lease gets shorter the value will decrease at a greater rate.\nLeasehold controversies\nWhilst whole houses are normally sold freehold, in recent years there has been an accelerating trend of leasehold houses (particularly new builds) with an estimated four million homeowners in England not owning the freehold rights to their property.\nWith leasehold new-builds it\u2019s particularly important to check the terms of the lease for onerous ground rent clauses. There have been numerous controversial cases of escalating ground rent, where ground rent charges would double every decade eventually causing the amount to spiral to absurd levels, leaving the buyer with an unsellable property.\nThere have also been instances where buyers are told they have the option to purchase the freehold rights to their new-build property after a period of time for an agreed fee (typically \u00a32000-\u00a33000), only for the landlord to then sell the freehold rights to an Investment Company who then charge the leaseholder severely over the odds to purchase it, often amounting to \u00a340,000 or more.\nThe unfair charges levied on buyers of leasehold new-builds have prompted proposals from Communities Secretary Sajid Javid to ban leaseholds on new-build houses in England.\nBe informed\nIt\u2019s important to make sure you fully understand what purchasing a freehold or leasehold property entails, from potential charges and fees to your rights and responsibilities. The more knowledge you have, the easier it will be to spot any potential problems. If you have any questions, speak to your conveyancing solicitor.\nRelated Content\n5 Tips For First Time Buyers\nMortgage Application Tips for First Time Buyers\nSocial Media\nSamantha Eaton\nAssociate Solicitor, Residential Property",

    "context": "The berth on the train was quite comfortable. The only distraction being my room mates exiting and returning to the compartment throughout the night. It's also a nice treat to use the time spent sleeping to complete a long journey. I went to bed speaking French, using francs as currency, and woke up in a new country, one that speaks Spanish and spends pesetas.\nThe Madrid subway system is pretty straight forward, much less confusing than the Paris metro. Not far from the subway is the pensione where I will stay tonight. The woman who answers the door is kind enough, but not overly friendly. This is a type of bed and breakfast accommodation, without the breakfast, and only costs $11 for the room.\nWith my knapsack safely tucked away, I explore Madrid with the help of the map from tourist information at the train station. Madrid is a beautiful city to wander in, with its lovely fountains. I take my time figuring out where to go next in a gorgeous park, full of lakes, trees and a crystal house.\nAround the city are vendors with little carts, much like the hot dog carts back in Toronto. Here you can buy a drink, which is anything from coke-a-cola to a martini. There is a little seating area that is available for an extra 100 pesetas.\nSpanish coffee is strong, like the coffee in Paris, but with a slightly different taste. The man at the bistro suggests I add lots of milk, stir and then sprinkle the sugar on top. The result is very tasty. While I enjoy my coffee, I discuss some of Spain's more popular festivals, like Tomatina, and the Running of the Bulls with another traveler.\nMadrid turns out to be more of a culinary experience, with so many interesting flavours of food and drink to discover. A small restaurant prepares perfectly spiced ravioli, served with delicious wine for my post city sight seeing dinner.\nBack at the pensione, and exhausted from a day of walking and eating, I flop into my bed. The mattress consumes me, folding up on either side like a fluffy, thick hammock. I have been transformed into a human hot dog, wrapped up a snug bun, covered with a blanket the exact same shade as French's mustard.\n\u2022 \u00a4 \u2022\n\"The poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese.\"\n~G.K.

The exhibit honed in on communities which are using grassroots actions, and local endeavours, to create unique architectural builds to stimulate their own economies. Yet it had its Scottish premier in a decomposing, former primary school, in the small seaside town of Oban. Not exactly the first location you think of for an exclusive exhibition premier.\nRockfield Primary School was opened in 1894 and closed nine years ago, and since its closure, the grade-B listed historical building had lain empty. Nobody would invest in it. In 2012 it was to be bulldozed down to create housing, but this led to Oban Communities Trust intervening to save the former school, and convert it into a cultural hub for the townspeople. The bid to purchase the building was approved by Argyll and Bute Council in 2015, and set the starting point to turn this damp, trodden and tired old build, into a vigorous, charming space in which to promote arts, culture and heritage. The intention of beneficial social and economic gain, from The Rockfield Centre project, was the driving factor behind the building being selected to hold the Prospect North exhibit.\nCabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop said: \u201cThe development process at The Rockfield Centre is admirable, and there is great synchronicity between the aims for the Centre, and aims of the projects shown within Prospect North.\n\u201cThe exhibition centres on exemplary community-led projects and so one could not wish for a more appropriate setting to have launched its tour.\u201d\nAs part of the Scottish government\u2019s year of Innovation, Architecture and Design, Architecture and Design Scotland (ADS) \u2013 who selected Lateral North for the Venice Biennale \u2013 became largely involved with the organisation of different events throughout the country, to coincide with 2016\u2019s themed year. Upon Oban Communities Trust\u2019s proposal for the Oban Festival of Architecture, the two organisations worked in alliance, to provide an opportunity to draw together an engaging series of local attractions, events and smaller exhibitions, in conjunction with the premier of Prospect North at the Rockfield Centre.\nChair of ADS, Karen Anderson, said: \u201cOnce we saw the space and the opportunity, we felt that Oban was the right place to bring the exhibition for its Scottish premier, after its time in Venice.\n\u201cThe enthusiasm of the community, and the Rockfield Centre itself, meant that we were delighted to bring Prospect North to Oban.\u201d\nThe exhibition showcased Scotland and its strategic positioning among its Nordic and arctic neighbours. Using augmented reality and VR headsets, the content was brought to life and demonstrated how architects and designers, have responded to challenges and opportunities across the country in recent years. The VR capabilities have the potential to enhance communities\u2019 understanding of the vision for architectural projects, and allow greater access to participating in them, particularly those living in rural areas of the country.\nOn the use of cutting-edge technology and software used within the exhibition, Anderson stated: \u201cThe approach by Lateral North and the fantastic technology developed by Soluis is a new way for audiences to engage with the stories of the places around us.\n\u201cTheir energy and vision made a huge contribution to the year of innovation, architecture and design, and I hope that their success provides inspiration to other people starting out in their chosen careers.\u201d\nThe exhibition was in-fact the evolution of what originally begun as part of a Strathclyde University student masters project in 2013, titled, From Fringe to Frontier. The then students \u2013 and now directors and co-founders of Lateral North \u2013 Tom Smith and Graham Hogg, began to look at Scotland\u2019s relation to the north. This process snowballed into projects such as Prospect North, which has allowed the Glasgow-based research and design collective to work collaboratively alongside: academics, entrepreneurs, economists, politicians and creatives around the world.\nSmith said: \u201cIt was a great honour and step up, for us to deliver a project,that represented our home country on behalf of the Venice partnership.\n\u201cAs a young architecture firm, we were inexperienced in delivering a project of this notability, but we felt as though this allowed us to approach the project in a slightly different manner \u2013 our youthfulness and ambitiousness was something that we wanted to carry throughout the exhibition.\u201d\nWhile Lateral North\u2019s commissioned exhibition came to a finish at the end of November in Dundee, communities across Scotland can still experience the entire thing. The miniature version hosts all the same components, allowing people in urban, suburban, rural, remote, coastal and island areas, to see what the Venice Biennale entry had to offer, from the inside of a van. Or as Smith puts it, \u201ca travelling workshop.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cThe exhibition was about promoting Scotland on both micro and macro scales, where community and designer collaboration, was at the heart of what was delivered.\n\u201cThe intent was to show this to as broad an audience as possible \u2013 both international and domestic \u2013 to convey what is happening in our country right now.\n\u201cAnd I believe that has been accomplished, as our evolved student project has now travelled across the seas, it has shown people from around the globe what architecture and design in Scotland has to offer.\u201d",
    "question": "What was the purpose of the Prospect North exhibition?",
    "answer": "The Prospect North exhibition was designed to explore the relationship between people, places, cultures, and industries throughout the peripheral northern isles such as Shetland, all the way down to the central belt in Glasgow. It focused on communities which are using grassroots actions, and local endeavours, to create unique architectural builds to stimulate their own economies.",

The cab ride to the airport was a bit crazy but we made it.\nIt was all down hill from there. The airport computers were being screwy and I waited for over two hours in the hot sun to get to the ticket counter. Then when I got there they gave me a hand written ticket for my bag. It just said st Thomas to Denver via Chicago. While in customs I realized I forgot my carry on at the ticket counter and had to go running back for it.\nThen once on the plane the pilot told us that the scheduled 3 hour flight was going to take 5. The drunk and very stinky lady next to me was upset and made a stink, ha ha pun intended. : ) The plane had no food on it, not even to buy so we got water and more water.... To watch a movie cost $8... I paid for it just do I didn't have to deal with the drunk lady.\nAfter a very long flight we arrived in Chicago and over half the plane had missed their connections. So off I went to stand in yet another long line. The good news was that united agreed to put us all up in a hotel and give us food vouchers.\nAs I expected... My bag was not with me in Chicago. I waited in another long line to find out that yes indeed my bag was not here. United was kind enough to give me a toothbrush and toothpaste and off I went to Stand another line for a shuttle to the hotel. Are you seeing a trend yet? Oh and by now its after 10pm.\nThe hotel was nice, double tree by Hilton. Apparently this happens so frequently that the restaurant had a separate menu that had prices that matched the prices of the food vouchers from United. I ate quickly and headed off to bed... Afterall I had to be up in 5 hours to go catch my next flight.\nThe next morning went fairly smoothly: up at 5, shuttle to airport, intense security and economy plus seat. The lady next to me was still drunk from the night before (different lady than first flight). What's up with me sitting next to drunk people??? The flight was super bumpy but I was able to sleep through most of it.\nIn a shocking turn of events... My bag was one of the first off in denver. I was shocked!!

    "context": "Date story was published: Tuesday, January 10, 1984\nJoe Hall likes to think of his bench as a means of changing a game's tempo. Last night, the Kentucky coach shifted gears and the Wildcats peeled away to a 76-66 victory over Alabama.\nFor about 30 minutes, the Cats and Alabama were locked in a tense, bumper- to-bumper race that saw neither team able to nose ahead by more than five points.\nAt that point, with Dicky Beal, Winston Bennett and James Blackmon inserted into the lineup, UK shifted into overdrive or -- more accurately -- hyperspace.\nNever miss a local story.\nThe trio off the bench combined with Kenny Walker and Melvin Turpin to form a devastating 2-2-1 trapping press. Quicker than you could say \"turnover,\" Alabama committed three straight and the Wildcats were on a roll.\nBefore it ended, UK had scored 14 straight points (breaking a 52-52 tie and assuming a 66-52 lead) and awaited only a checkered flag.\n\"We didn't show up tonight until the second half,\" Hall said. \"It was good that we did show up.\"\nThe Cats weren't all that bad in the first half. Alabama was nearly flawless -- \"As close to playing the way I wanted them to as a coach can expect,\" Tide Coach Wimp Sanderson said -- yet UK trailed only 34-33 at intermission.\nThe two teams were deadlocked at 52-52 eight minutes into the second half. After a television timeout at the 11:31 mark, UK sprang its trap.\nThe press reaped two turnovers immediately, and Walker and Turpin converted with dunks.\nNow rattled, Alabama went scoreless for more than five minutes. On 10 possessions, the Tide committed seven turnovers.\nWhen the draught ended, with a jam by Tide center Bobby Lee Hurt, so had the game. An Alabama surge at the end, which narrowed a one-time 18point deficit (74-56) to 10 at the finish, was of small consolation.\n\"For 35 minutes, we played as hard and as intelligently as we can,\" Sanderson said. \"We then had five very poor minutes against the press and that took us out of the ball game.\"\nThe game and Eric Richardson's left ankle turned on the same play.\nRichardson, Alabama's only experienced guard, turned his ankle the first time UK applied the press.\nAs he got the ball near mid-court, Richardson was trapped by Beal and Blackmon. As Walker closed in, the 6foot-3 senior jumped to make a pass. His left foot landed on Blackmon's foot.\nHis tipped pass went to Walker, who raced downcourt for a twisting \"stuff-er-rino,\" as ESPN announcer Joe Dean probably called it.\n\"I saw I was in the clear,\" Walker said. \"I said, 'What the heck. I'll get the fans excited and get this game on the road.' \"\nRichardson, meanwhile, was limping off the court, his trip cut short.\n\"We had worked against a press,\" Richardson said afternoon, his left foot soaking in a tub of ice water. \"We thought they might use it early. When they did use it, it was a good time for them and a bad time for us.\n\"We felt we had them playing our tempo. We were trying to be patient and make them work on defense.\"\nUK's press made a shambles of those plans.\nThe 14 straight points were reminiscent of UK blitzes of Brigham Young (23 straight points) and Purdue (15 straight) earlier this season. The result as an 11th straight victory this season. In the process, the Cats tied Auburn for the early Southeastern Conference lead at 3-0.\nAlabama, which ironically lost senior guard Mike Davis to a broken hand at Rupp Arena last season, fell to 8-4 overall and 1-2 in the SEC.\n\"People who know me know I'm not an alibi coach,\" Sanderson said. \"But, we don't have a lot of people who are ready to play and can't afford to have anyone hurt.\"\nBeal, who had eight assists and eight points in a frenetic 17 minutes of play, make no bones about it.\n\"That was the key,\" Beal said of Richardson's injury. \"They didn't have an experienced ball-handler.\"",

    "context": "SCIO \u2014 By tapping into the program\u2019s traditional identity, Kyle Braa has transformed Scio High into a perennial football contender.\nBraa, in his eighth season as head coach, is 78-16 overall with six league championships (two Tri-River Conference, four PacWest Conference) and a pair of 2A state titles. A prolific rushing attack coupled with a physical defense were the hallmarks of each team.\nThe formula hasn\u2019t changed in 2017 as the top-seeded Loggers (9-1) prepare for Saturday\u2019s matchup with No. 4 Cascade Christian (10-1) at Cottage Grove High in the 3A state semifinals. Kickoff is scheduled for noon with the winner advancing to meet No. 11 Rainier (9-2) or No. 2 Santiam Christian (9-2) in next week\u2019s finals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about all of my coaches,\u201d said Braa, a 2001 Scio graduate who went on to play at Western Oregon. \u201cWe are all on the same page, we have the same vision and we know how we want to do things. It\u2019s kind of a brotherhood here and we just understand the vision of Scio sports.\u201d\nThe majority of Braa\u2019s staff is comprised of fellow Scio alumni.\nAssistant coaches Casey Childress and Jon Rounsavell graduated with Braa in 2001 while Matt Parazoo (class of 1994), Sam Gray (1997), Mike Ferguson (1999), Justin Guest (2011) and Harley Stephenson (2013) also attended Scio. Chad Peck and Will Baldwin have become adopted Loggers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the best coaching staffs you could be around,\u201d said senior Jake Lowther, the PacWest offensive lineman of the year. \u201cThey all work together real well so it makes us feel like we\u2019re smarter even though we are just listening to them. Our coaches, they are just awesome from top to bottom.\u201d\nAdded senior running back and defensive back Brody Foster: \u201cAt first I was a little intimidated because they are all bigger, serious guys. But now that I\u2019ve been through the program, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. They are guys that are very smart in football and they\u2019ve put endless hours into it to help us out, especially around this time of the year.\u201d\nBraa\u2019s initial stint as head coach lasted from 2007-10. The Loggers went 14-9 during his first two years before rattling off consecutive 14-0 records en route to the 2009 and 2010 2A state titles.\nAfter walking away to focus on family and graduate school, Braa returned to the helm prior to the 2014 season. Jim Mask, Scio\u2019s current athletic director, went 28-8 in Braa\u2019s stead.\n\u201cMy wife had our first kid, I had to go back and get my master\u2019s and I was still the AD at the time. It just seemed really overwhelming trying to do all that,\u201d Braa said of his decision to stop coaching. \u201cSo I stepped back, got my master\u2019s done, my kid grew up a little bit and my wife was OK with me getting back into the deal.\u201d\nThe Loggers have never missed the postseason under Braa, qualifying for six quarterfinals, five semifinals and two title games.\nBraa credits the community\u2019s youth programs for the varsity team\u2019s consistency.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had really good middle school coaching that\u2019s helped with the fundamentals,\u201d Braa said. \u201cWhen kids come up to the high school level, I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re ready for varsity football by any stretch, but they\u2019ve got a good foundation, and that\u2019s helped us a lot.\u201d\nScio got off to a 6-0 start last fall and was poised for another deep playoff run before several injuries crippled its chances. The Loggers limped into the round of 16 and were routed by Cascade Christian, 49-0, to end the season.\nThe Challengers ran through the battered Loggers while quarterback Haiden Schaan, a two-time Southern Cascade League offensive player of the year, was effective in the passing game.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that loss,\u201d Lowther said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were even prepared for the week because we were so scrambled, trying to figure out who we were going to put where. Just no one was healthy and as much as you don\u2019t want to use that as an excuse, that\u2019s really what happened.\u201d\nSchaan is now a senior for the Challengers, who average a 3A-best 48.8 points per game. Cascade Christian\u2019s defense gives up just 15.5 per contest.\nScio\u2019s offense (44 points per game) and defense (16.8) have put up similar numbers this fall.\n\u201cThey caught us at our worst moment last year, and we certainly remember the 49-0 game,\u201d Braa said. \u201cIn addition to playing another week, that\u2019s a bit of extra motivation.\n\u201cWe are hitting our stride at the right time. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve peaked yet, hopefully that\u2019s this weekend, but we are getting there and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question.",

Vulnerable children require a deep investment, and police, hospitals, schools, foundations and social service agencies are only the first to help in the prevention of child abuse. Each of these organizations and coalitions gives vital support to children and families at risk, but the bottom line is: Invest in our children today, and we\u2019ll all reap the benefits for years to come.\nEditorial: Stiffen child abuse penalty (and) New ways to reduce child abuse\nAbstract\nNinety-one child sex offenders were interviewed about the methods they used to target children, the age range of their victims, how they selected children and maintained them as victims, and what suggestions they had for preventing child sexual abuse. Offenders were selected from treatment programs, probation, special hospitals, and prisons. They were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results indicate that offenders gained access to children through caretaking, such as babysitting; targeted children by using bribes, gifts and games; used force, anger, threats, and bribes to ensure their continuing compliance; and systematically desensitized children through touch, talk about sex, and persuasion. Nearly half the offenders had no bad feelings about sexually abusing children. The implications for prevention programs are discussed.\nAbuse Prevention\nWHAT IS ABUSE AND NEGLECT?\nAccording to the Missouri Legislature the following definitions apply to abuse and neglect:\nABUSE:\nAny physical injury, sexual abuse, or emotional abuse inflicted on a child other than by accidental means by those responsible for the child\u2019s care, custody, and control; except that discipline including spanking, administered in a reasonable manner, shall not be construed to be abuse.\nNEGLECT:\nThe failure to provide. Welfare Information Gateway\nParental Resilience: Protective & Promotive Factors\nNumerous researchers have concluded that how parents respond to stressors is much more important than the stressor itself in determining the outcomes for themselves and their children. Parents are more likely to achieve healthy, favorable outcomes if they are resilient. Resilience is the process of managing stress and functioning well even when faced with challenges, adversity and trauma. Some stressors parents face can be managed easily so that problems get resolved; for example, calling a relative or friend to pick-up a child from school when a parent is delayed. But some stressors cannot be easily resolved. For example, parents cannot \u201cfix\u201d their child\u2019s developmental disability, erase the abuse they suffered as a child or be able to move out of a crime-plagued neighborhood. Rather, parents are resilient when they are able to call forth their inner strength to proactively meet personal challenges and those in relation to their child, manage adversities, heal the effects of trauma and thrive given the unique characteristics and circumstances of their!!",

Not only are we called to compassion and kindness, but our love also needs to be expressed in actions for justice. The prophets consistently called for worship that will translate into justice, for systemic change and for social transformation.\nIt is not enough to assume that personal conversion will lead to social change. We have to be more intentional as churches to nurture a holistic spirituality that will go beyond personal conversion and piety, to interpersonal reconciliation, and social justice. Our discipleship process should help Christians to contextualise and apply their faith into the realities of everyday life in our communities, at the work place, in board rooms and on the streets.

    "context": "So I know that Project Life and Pocket Scrapbooking is all the rage at the moment and that week-by-week documentation is the preferred method of many a scrapbooker but it\u2019s one thing that I have decided was just not for me. I\u2019ve tried a couple of spreads for various class challenges and just to dabble but had a bit of a hard time with the division between elements. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019ll apply forever and I could totally see myself using it to document a pregnancy, or the first year of my baby\u2019s life, or some other topic driven scrapbook but as an ongoing project, keeping up with PL\u2026 I just wouldn\u2019t have enough motivation to keep me interested. Besides I am waaaayyy too in love with the 12\u00d712 canvas, and that does not look like its gonna change in a hurry.\nAll that said, I\u2019m a bit of a fan of all the gorgeous kits that keep coming out (OMG have you seen the Heidi+Becky collaboration, just sayin\u2019) and as a reader of Becky\u2019s Blog, just her whole approach to memory keeping and engaging with her customers really inspires me. So what\u2019s a girl to do when she wants to get her hands on some cool product and play a little but not commit to the whole she-bang: go small to get her feet wet.\nI\u2019ve mentioned before that for the last few years we\u2019ve had the opportunity to host people in our home from other countries and learn a little about their cultures. Well the two fellas with us most recently had finished their stint here and I was looking for a way to give them a going-away pressie that was meaningful but could be put together fairly quick. A lot of the main impetus behind the Project Life brand was to find a managable way of documenting life without it getting to complicated. So I thought it was a good fit for this project, all I wanted to do was stick cards in the pockets add my pictures and call it good. In the end I did add a little bit of stamping for tabs and titles but that was about all the embellishing this got.\nIt really was as simple and easy as it should have been and the photos remain centre stage which is really what I wanted for this album. Given the audience I thought simple would be rather appropriate. I did include journaling cards and invited the blokes to write down some of their memories and thoughts on being here but given that it\u2019s two single blokes on the receiving end of these I don\u2019t hold out much hope that they will. The design really needed to ensure that the message could still hold up even with out it and I\u2019m confident that it does.\nSo what are my takeaways from doing this project? It was suitable for the end-product I wanted to produce. Keeping it simple allowed me to get it done in the short amount of time that I had to do it. A few little extras help bring the message home. Ultimatly Project Life is still not for me. While I pleased with what I made, I felt that there was not enough in the creative process that allowed me to \u2018play\u2019. You may well say that there are plenty of scrappers out there who do engage in creative play but I have found that the tiny 3\u00d74 or even 4\u00d76 size of a PL card is just too small for me. Part of what I enjoy so much with the 12 x 12 canvas is the act of creative play. Picking my photos, developing my story and then moving little bits of paper, stickers and whatever else around my page to find a design that I find attractive. I really come alive when I have elements I want to include on a layout but have to figure out how to make them fit together. Spending that time finding a creative solution to a design problem is what lights me up and there was definitely not enough of that in this project.\nFor my two albums I used Project Life Mini Albums filled with mostly the Jade Edition Core Kit (album above), the Cut & Paste Mini Edition (album not shown), with a few cards from the Wellington Childhood Edition and a bunch from their Australia Themed Card Kit thrown in for good measure. I especially love the Wellington cards and have also just snagged myself a Cinnamon Core Kit & DIY Shop kit super cheap this past week for use on my 12 x12\u2019s. Both Cinnamon and the DIY Shop kit have colours and designs that I use All. The. Time. in my pages so I\u2019m sure they will not go to waste. I\u2019m excited to see how I can alter, crop and just generally \u2018play\u2019 with them to make them work for me.\nI really hope the guys enjoy their little reminder of their time in Tassie. This was a really helpful experiment in scrapping for me.

There's a lot of money at stake: Because health benefits are excluded from payroll and income taxes, the U.S. Treasury lost out on $226 billion in 2008, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nPolitically,.\nThere's also \"a lurking fear that the whole basis of employer-sponsored health insurance system may be at risk if we start fooling around with the tax exemption,\" Bos said.\nHow would all this affect you? Currently, workers who get health insurance from their employers don't pay income or payroll taxes on the cost of the policy. Self-employed people can deduct the cost of their premiums. But workers who don't get employer coverage and buy their own policies generally don't get the tax break.\nIdeas for changing current policies fall into three broad categories: taxing health benefits above a certain dollar amount, taxing only wealthier people, or replacing the tax break with a tax credit.\nOption 1: Cap The Tax Break\nThis would tax workers on the portion of their health benefits that exceeds a set amount. Determining that benchmark is tricky. The higher it is, the less revenue government would collect.\nThe benchmark could be the national average premium for comprehensive policies. Those policies currently cost on average $4,704 a year for single workers or $12,680 for family coverage, according to an annual survey of employers by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Top 10 RB?\n\u2014 TDs (@F4NT45Y_TDs) September 27, 2016\nThis is the tweet that Twitter has been waiting for for half a decade. Well, not quite that long, but Christine Michael's athletic profile has gotten fantasy footballers excited since he entered the league. He was unable to crack the starting lineup or stay on the roster last year, and that includes the Seattle Seahawks, the Dallas Cowboys, and Washington.\nMichael emerged this offseason amid injury concerns for Thomas Rawls, who is out for \"a few weeks\" with a fibula injury. He has taken the starting role and, well, ran with it. He has played at least 63% of his team's offensive snaps in all three games so far, something only 10 other running backs can say.\nAnd he's been doing well, too. In terms of our Rushing Net Expected Points (NEP) metric, 44.44% of his carries have led to positive expected points gains, which ranks 14th among 39 backs with at least 20 carries. His teammates, though, have a Success Rate of just 27.59%. He's excelling while his teammates have struggled, so it's looking like he can outplay this offensive line. If and when the passing offense hits its stride, look out. With a mostly unmatched role in the offense and his promising metrics, yeah, C-Mike is pretty much a top-10 back moving forward.\n@numberFire should I trade D. Thomas and Christine Michael for CJ Anderson\n\u2014 Darquane McCduffie (@lukejones72) September 27, 2016\nSo, we just mentioned that only 11 running backs have played at least 60% of snaps this year, and DeAngelo Williams is about to fall out of that group this week with Le'Veon Bell's return. One of the guys in that group is C.J. Anderson, making him one of the few \"everydown\" backs through two weeks.\nThe main difference right now between Anderson and Michael (if we overlook their draft costs) is the offense. The Denver Broncos rank 8th in Adjusted NEP per play, and the Seahawks rank 19th. It's early and Seattle will likely climb back up the ranks, but it's never bad to tie your assets to good offenses. However the other variable in this is that Demaryius Thomas is also part of that eighth-ranked offense. His 20 targets are concerning, but he ranks 16th in Reception NEP per target among 73 receivers with at least 15 targets.\nWith how Michael is playing, though, and with games against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons up next for Thomas, accepting this two-for-one for Anderson tough to justify.\n@numberFire Is Julio going to have a 2015 AJ Green season? Atlanta seems to be spreading the ball around much like Cincinnati did with green\n\u2014 Adam Faucheux (@Afaucheux70) September 27, 2016\nIt's very possible, Adam. Julio Jones has 20 targets through three games on the 20th-most pass-heavy team in the NFL. Last season, Jones finished with 203 targets, a top-three mark since 2000. His current pace puts him at 106.\nJones is tied with Demaryius Thomas for 16th in Reception NEP per target among 73 receivers with at least 15 targets, so he's being efficient, but he's tied with Jacob Tamme in targets, and 8 Falcons have at least 5 targets.\nWhereas Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders are looking to get more involved in the offense and combined for 20 targets in Week 3, we can't be quite as optimistic for Jones.\nOffensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan has said that the team won't force it to Jones, either. Up next on the schedule before their Week 11 bye are the Carolina Panthers (8th in Adjusted Defensive Passing NEP per play), the Broncos (5th), the Seahawks (4th), the San Diego Chargers (9th), the Green Bay Packers (28th), the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (24th), and the Philadelphia Eagles (1st).\nIt's not looking great.\nWant to have your questions answered in our mailbag?

Insider Monkey has recently published an interesting article about it giving you some advice. Many websites function as a search engine for finding private equity executive search firms and private equity headhunters. However, none of them tells you which are the best ones. In order to find out on their own, they, at Insider Monkey took suggestions from different sources such as Forbes of best executive recruiting firms, the Wall street Oasis Forum where people made a list based on their own experience and the Interview Private Equity, official guide for private equity firms, to name few. Then Insider Monkey took the most repeated suggestions of private equity search firms and headhunters and ranked them in that manner.\nNow without a further ado let\u2019s see what Insider Monkey has investigated for us. We have picked three of best private equity search firms and headhunters in America from their list.\nThe first one can be Phoenix Group International. This private equity search firm is based in Arizona. What distinguishes it from the other, as mentioned on their website, is its high engagement \u201cat every stage of the recruitment and hiring process.\u201d Phoenix Group International ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of best private equity search firms and headhunters in America and it embraces technology, but at the same time, relies on its professional service qualities. The second one on our short list should be Spencer Stuart. Spencer Stuart is an American global search firm which is based in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1956, and since then it developed its reach to 30 countries and 56 offices in total. Besides headhunting, it also offers leadership consulting, and help in planning and human resource development. At last, but not least we are recommending.",

Adding to the excitement, right behind them was a pack of fast, veteran teams looking to capitalize on the most minor mistake.\nOnce again, PRO Blake Middleton in charge of the Coconut Grove Sailing Club (CGSC) Race Committee set a great race course and started racing on time at noon.\nWith many teams feeling burned from Day One, and the right side paying so big, a sizeable portion of the fleet b-lined it to the right side and once again found themselves in good positions at the top. Drew Freides on Pacific Yankee looked like they were shot out of a cannon as they crossed the fleet on starboard tack. Thanks to some heavy air training prior to the World Championship last October, Freides led wire to wire and took the win followed by John Kilroy\u2019s Samba Pa Ti in second and Wilson in third.\nRace Five (in a potential series of eight) gave the first glimpse of any sort of left shift working as the majority of the those who dug to the right side early got crushed, and those that were furthest left were able to sail a great angle on port tack with solid pressure. Bob Hughes\u2019 Heartbreaker got left after a tough start to join the lead group, but it would be Liam Kilroy who took the bullet when the dust settled, followed by his dad in second and the blazing fast Brazilian Cesar Gomes Neto on Portobello finished third.\nThe final race of the day provided the most tricky conditions as the first beat had a few sizable shifts, but leading at the first mark again from the right side was long-time Melges 20 owner Daniel Thielman on Kuai. Sailing fast up and down, he did his best to hold off a charge from the younger Kilroy (who eventually took the win). Thielman stayed close coming second followed by John Kilroy in third.\nWinning the day and moving into first overall with a 4-1-1 score card, Liam gave credit to his team on their strong performance, and of course, sage advice from his father. \u201cThe team did a great job today. We were able to execute our game plan and like my Dad always says, keep the boat moving fast,\u201d commented Liam at the end of Day Two.\nCORINTHIAN CONGA\nTaking a tumble in the overall standings, but maintaining a healthy lead for first in the Corinthian fleet, Bruce and Jay Golison are looking to solidify their win with a great final day. Rounding out the Corinthian podium is John Brown\u2019s Blind Squirrel in second, and Paul Currie on Wild Deuces just a few points behind.\nWith a mixed forecast of rain and a strong breeze out of the Northeast, the tropical conditions the fleet experienced today may be gone, but the racing will still be full on with plenty of more tight racing to come.\nTOP TEN RESULTS (Preliminary - After Six Races, One Discard)\n1.)

    "context": "When saying retro, probably one of the first things that comes to our mind are the recollections of the past popular style images, which do have certain moments of comeback in our everyday life. The influence of the past decades in regards of the stylish options and interpretations we opt for is certainly noticeable in the looks. This is also true in case of the celebs\u2019 looks, who occasionally turn to the 20s\u2019, 40s\u2019, or 50s\u2019 styles for inspiration, and the modernized looks of theirs rising as a result of this impact are as a rule quite successful. Thus, here we have a brief list of retro style tips, which will get you into a small journey to the past, in order to find the key looks of the past decades of fashion changes.\nLuxurious and Glittery Chic\nThe main fashion trends spanning around the 20s\u2019 noted for the economic rise of the US, are quite popular with the extravagant and maximum shiny looks ladies opted for when choosing their everyday garments. One especially vivid exemplar of the looks of those times is illustrated with the images of the popular film \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d, presented to the audience in 2013, in which the main actress Carey Mulligan can be found with looks exceptionally typical of those times. What makes them differ from the other decades\u2019 options is the super sumptuous details accompanying the garments. They could be put as bows, draping designs, floral appliqu\u00e9s, and sumptuous fur elements. In addition, ladies picked some super luxurious and lavish jewelry for their party looks, in order to be ultimately blinding. The wide range of headwear accessories was also a remarkable part of their looks. So were the short haircuts like finger wavy bobs and pixies.\nLet the Color Shine!\nAfter this glitter-driven period, the color plays, especially frequent with bright shades became quite popular for the fashion trends. The war-centered 40s\u2019 were especially popular with the bright and lively images, made of the signature pin up hairstyle for instance, accompanied by some ruffled and full shapes for dresses and skirts, and some bold d\u00e9collet\u00e9 shapes for tops, too. The images, however, never get even close to provocative and too daring. The hairstyle here as well, remains within the shapes of short or medium length, often curly or wavy, and also matching the bright makeup, made of arrows for the eyes, blinding classic shade of red for lips and rosy cheeks. Some hints of this style may be observed with the looks of popular singer Christina Aguilera, especially in case of the pin up hairstyle.\nLet the Classic Chic In\nFurther in the 1950s, we can see a comparative comeback of the 20s\u2019 principles to some extent, namely in case of the return of headwear details, which become integral parts of the ladies\u2019 looks again. For this period the emergence of monochrome and bright color interpretations for garments may be seen, the complementary accessories for which were the gloves. The dresses and skirts encompassed ruffled, pleated, and straight shapes like tubes and pencils, generally cut at knee level. One of the most explicit embodiments of those times\u2019 elegance is Dita Von Teese, who can be observed with more and more feminine, yet retro inspired looks, having all the descriptive elements of those times, at the same time not omitting the modern influence, either.\nSo here were some general retro styles and tips for the retro inspired looks of yours. This trend, like any other in the fashion world is capable of presenting you with flawless looks, in case of being implemented and matched correctly.\nPhotos courtesy of Elle, Vogue",

    "context": "12:43 p.m. | Updated Before a federal jury found him guilty on Monday, former State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. seemed to be channeling his inner Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\nNow it was Mr. Espada who, like Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, detected satanic forces.\nFor protection against \u201cevil spiritual powers,\u201d he went around the other day with a rosary-attached cross dangling prominently from his neck. Members of his entourage wore red, a color that they said was another way to ward off evil. If you next see Mr. Espada clutching a clove of garlic, you\u2019ll know he suspects that vampires, too, are out to get him.\nHis Lucifer is the United States government, whose lawyers had a hard time convincing a jury in Brooklyn that the former senator \u2014 who might be referred to with greater precision as the thoroughly disgraced former senator \u2014 was the crook they said he was.\nOn Monday, on their 11th day of deliberations in the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, jurors pronounced him guilty on four counts of theft in the embezzlement case against him and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada. No verdict was reached, not yet anyway, against the son. The case turned on charges that the Espadas looted a nonprofit health care network to treat themselves to hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of high living, including sushi and lobster dinners, spa getaways and luxury cars.\nFor many days, the jurors seemed to be doing some channeling themselves: summoning their inner Gordon Gekko, the character in the film \u201cWall Street\u201d best known for the line that \u201cgreed, for lack of a better word, is good.\u201d In this case, it may well have been that some jurors believed that greed, if not good, was at least acceptable.\nThat Mr. Espada has an avaricious streak wider than the Cross Bronx Expressway is hard to dispute. The evidence of lavish spending is ample.\nThe tensions within the jury may have been about the Espadas\u2019 claim to a right to have done whatever they wished with all that money, never mind that everyone else was left holding their noses. At the trial\u2019s start in March, the former senator\u2019s lawyer told jurors that her client \u201cwas entitled to spend the money in the way that he did.\u201d\nIf Mr. Espada says he is bedeviled, think how federal prosecutors must have felt. They have had a rough time in several recent cases trying to convince juries to convict New York politicians charged with felonious possession of sticky fingers.\nIn December, a federal jury in Manhattan failed to reach a verdict in the corruption trial of City Councilman Larry B. Seabrook, who was accused of money laundering and extortion to enrich relatives, friends and himself. Mr. Seabrook may deserve to be forever known as Bagel Larry for a charge that he doctored a $7 receipt for a bagel sandwich and a soda so that he could get $177 back from a political club. He now faces a new trial. In the meantime, his City Council privileges to decide how public money is spent in his Bronx district have been revoked.\nThen we have Assemblyman William F. Boyland Jr., acquitted last November by another federal jury in Manhattan of conspiring to take bribes from a health care group. Mr. Boyland was later brought up on a separate set of bribery charges.\nThe November verdict was a devilment of its own, because the head of the health care group had previously been convicted of conspiring to give those bribes. In other words, he offered payoffs to a man who, to go by the Boyland jurors\u2019 logic, didn\u2019t receive them. As long as we\u2019re dabbling in religion and mysticism, we might as well call it the immaculate reception.\nAs for the elder Espada, everything about him \u2014 his outsized sense of entitlement, his flaunting of large sums spent on himself, his Ch\u00e1vez-like antics \u2014 should give former colleagues in Albany pause, be they his fellow Democrats or Republicans. They had once thought him worthy of leadership positions. No courtroom verdict was needed to figure out what it says about their own judgment.",

    "context": "This time I decided to use \u00bd litre of beans instead of a full litre because of the juggling of pots and containers required by a full litre. It was much easier and faster. We removed as many of the skins as possible to help remove the beany taste and then we boiled them and drained the water 4 times hoping to further reduce the beany taste. Then we pur\u00e9ed them in the blender again. With the blender less full, the pur\u00e9 was much finer. A litre of water was used. Although the mixture was not as thick as last time, I decided to add a \u00bc of water to give a bit more soymilk. As with the last attempt, I boiled the mixture at a high temperature setting for 10 minutes stirring constantly. When it came to a boil, I turned the temperature down to simmer and cooked for another 10 minutes stirring constantly.\nStraining the mixture was also a great deal easier and faster because of the reduced quantity. As with the last attempt, I decided to do another batch from the pur\u00e9. I put the pur\u00e9 back in the pot, added a \u00bc litre of water, brought it to a boil and put it through the strainer again.\nThere was a very fine residue that passed through the strainer on the last attempt which tasted like a soft grit. So we decided to filter the soymilk one last time. We decided to use a jelly bag rather than a cheese cloth because it could be reused and cleaned up easily.\nThe taste was still beany. In fact, it was impossible to tell the difference in taste between this attempt and the last.\nAfter chilling the soymilk, per the above linked article on making stove-top soymilk, I added maple syrup to taste and \u00bc tsp of salt.\nWE HAVE EDIBLE SOYMILK!\n(barely and only if you use it in coffee)\nIn my research, I\u2019ve come across comments that the quality of the soymilk and its taste are affected by the type of soybeans that you use and their freshness. There are specialty or novel soybeans which are used to produce various soyfoods of Asian origin, such as tofu, miso, soy sauce, natto, soymilk, and tempeh. Other than Laura soybeans, I\u2019ve seen no specific type of soymilk-associated bean available commercially. I will continue to search.\nSecondly, and more importantly, I came across information that said to skip the soaking stage and place uncooked beans into boiling water:\nIn 1969 Mattick and Hand at Cornell.\nand\nThe beany flavor comes from a reaction involving the enzyme lipoxgenase (not trypsin inhibitor) enzyme, fat, water and oxygen. The method you are using, soaking in water and grinding will produce good quality soymilk but it will have the beany taste. To avoid the beany taste try the following. Take whole, unsoaked soybean and drop them into vigorously boiling water at least a 5:1 water to bean ratio. Cook for 30 minutes prior to grinding. Dehulling will remove the fiber and result in a soymilk with a smoother mouth feel but it will not reduce the beany flavor. Baking soda will improve the mouth feel and flavor of your soymilk but will not affect the beany flavor. Phytic acid is not destroyed by heat, at least not the heat you are using. It does not affect the beany taste. in a hot water solution of sodium bicarbonate converts the soybeans into a colloid solution (soyslurry) without unwanted enzyme activity.\nand from the National Soybean Research Laboratory\nMethod\n1..\n2. Grind the beans: Grind the blanched beans with 8 cups (2 liters) of hot water for 3 minutes using a blender on high speed. (If the blender is not large enough, do this in two batches.) Work carefully and be sure the lid is on tight as this is hot.\n3. Strain the mixture: Cool the mixture until it is just warm to the touch and filter it by squeezing it through a cheesecloth. Reserve the solids (okara) for another use.\n4. Simmer: Simmer the filtered liquid on the stove for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. If desired, add sugar, salt, and/or other flavorings to taste.\nSo we will make one last batch of soymilk using a portion of the Laura soybeans that I have and reserve the rest for seed. And we will skip the soaking stage and put the beans directly into boiling water.\nIf you use a Blendtech Blender you dont have to strain it. These blenders are $400 but they turn any food or rock or wood into a consistency like mayo as an option. Completely smooth for any food type. My milk taste great. Thanks",
    "question": "What steps were taken to reduce the beany taste in the soymilk preparation process?",
    "answer": "To reduce the beany taste in the soymilk, the beans were boiled and the water was drained 4 times. The skins were also removed as much as possible. The mixture was then pur\u00e9ed in a blender. Despite these steps, the taste was still beany.",

    "context": "The Hidden Joys of Blindness\nBeing blind is often not fun. There are challenges and setbacks, disappointments and discouraging moments. But that\u2019s all they are \u2013 setbacks. For the most part they are surmountable. In the year that I\u2019ve been blind, I\u2019m continually discovering many new joys of life that I had never noticed before, previously hidden by my vision.\nWhile riding a Milwaukee to Chicago Amtrak for a holiday luncheon, I experienced the rich soundscape comprised of the train horn wistfully blowing as we sped through the small rural towns, the unmistakable ringing of the crossing bells, the murmur of quiet conversations around me, the conductor announcing the stops and the gentle rocking of the cars navigating the rails \u2013 that together gave me a strong sense of orientation, making me forget I was even blind. I don\u2019t think that I had ever paid attention to these rich and colorful sensibilities before I had lost my vision. It was my first train trip since I lost my vision, and perhaps a bit ambitious, but I did it. On my own, keenly focused on my other senses, guided by my white cane and electronic navigating tools, all giving me a stronger sense of confidence and independence.\nThe luncheon went well, but on the return trip I got a bit disoriented in Chicago\u2019s Union Station, causing me to miss my train. I was eventually led to the proper but crowded area, now waiting for a train not expected for another 90 minutes. With a visible disability such as blindness, reinforced by being dragged around by train station personnel, I felt embarrassingly marked as a disabled person and generally shunned. I stood alone while feeling the glances of people around me who seemed to be working hard to be invisible \u2013 even though you know they\u2019re there, it seems like they hope someone else will step up and interact with you \u2013 as if blindness would be contagious if they got too close.\nThen a miracle occurred when I was spotted by another woman, who kindly got up and offered me her seat. I thanked her, but said I could stand and wait for the train. But just then, a seat opened up next to her and I happily seated myself. She offered me some of her coffee on that frigid Chicago night, which I immediately accepted, not only because I really wanted a sip, but to acknowledge her kindness.\nHer name is Peggy Anne. We talked until the train came. It turned out that her mother had been blind, thus she knew how to help a blind person without making them feel helpless or pitiful \u2014 I am not either. She asked me if I needed assistance, rather than just pulling my arms as many do. She treated me with dignity and respect and did not dwell on my blindness. We quickly became friends as we discussed a myriad of topics and solved many global issues together. We realized we had a lot in common \u2013 from life tragedies to blessings, a common spiritual perspective and a mutual ability to overcome life\u2019s obstacles.\nI also have a broken ankle and am not able to walk, certainly not all the way up the platform to the \u201cdisability\u201d car in front. So I had arranged for a Red Cap, a needed service for us broken-boned blind folks. When the train arrived and started boarding, I waited patiently for the Red Cap, to no avail. Fortunately, my new friend ran out to the conductor to determine what had happened, only to find they had forgotten about the disabled person and said the train had to leave regardless. But due to her determination, she was able to flag down another Red Cap and he quickly got me onto the transport. I was also able to convince him that Peggy Anne was my \u201cseeing-eye friend,\u201d so he got us both onto the train just in time, where we sat together and continued to solve world problems and deepen our friendship.\nTrue friendships are rare. Finding a friend whom you can celebrate all of their being is uncommon. If I was not blind and able to walk, I never would have met Peggy Anne \u2013 an amazing person full of kindness and joy, in a season heralded to be all about those kinds of values. I can now better understand what Helen Keller meant when she said, \u201cWalking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.\u201d Thank you Peggy Anne for being my friend. You have enlightened my world during this time of lights and bells, cookies and songs and peace on earth.\nWe want to hear your story. Become a Mighty contributor here.",

His piercing attached to his sheath with a metal chain around his neck. It wasn't as much pain as it was pleasure something he loved equally.\nThe forest grew darker as the sun went down and was setting. It would be dark soon so the stud knew he had to find a place to sleep for a bit knowing it would be worse to end up staying awake all day and night.\nHe had to stand guard for his clan, his duty was to stand guard at all time so he would have to sleep soon his shift started at dawn. As he laid down to sleep the appy stud caught scent of two horses, both seeming to be male. Sighing he got up and began following it. His clans leader asking him to check it out, like the good guy he was he stupidly agreed.\nSighing he began walking back toward the scent his ears perked forward as he saw two studs grazing together. One was a Bay Pangare Blanket Appaloosa the other standing like a mare looked like a Bay Varnish Appaloosa Overo. Both just as handsome as the next.\nUpon seeing him coming their way they stopped talking and began walking his way. \"Oh hello there, I'm Kareem, this is Samuelson.\" The mare looking one said. Kylar dipped his head politely, looking over the two new faces a slight smile on his lips. \"I'm Kylar, nice to meet you both.\" He replied. The blue roan blanket Appaloosa noticed Samuelson looking at his piercing curiously and smirked but said nothing, he was going to make him be brave enough to ask.\n\"So what are you too up to on rover territory?\" Kylar asked his tone light but demanding they answer his question. \"Oh sorry, we didn't realize, we were just exploring, we bumped into each other on the way and decided to stick together. We will take our leave all we ask is if we can stay the night then cross over in the morning?\" It was Samuelson who spoke both studs seemed nice enough so Kylar sighed. \"If you stick with me I can show you around for a bit. Then maybe you both can join my herd if you choose it.\" He offered. Both stallions looked at each other then shrugged looking back at him. \"Yes please show us around, then when it's done we'll tell you our choices.\" Kareem said for the both of them.\nAfter that all three studs laid down the two close together for warmth, Kylar lid a few feet away so he could keep a better eye on them. He may be nice bit he wasn't stupid he knew how well some horses could act, after all when the king of his old homeland came around he parents pretended to care about him and they did it perfectly the king never knew the truth, he still didn't know because as soon as Kylar turned two he ran for it.\nKylar had woke up long before the two studs and had talked to Ryder so he was excused until the intruders were gone. Now the Appaloosa stud stood nearby waiting for the pair to wake up so they could do their exploring and leave or join his herd. Which ever one they chose. He hoped for the latter sense he didn't currently have any herd members soon that would change even if he had to keep trying.\nThe first to wake was the bay, he stretched as he got to his hooves. \"Morning Kylar, how long have you been up?\" He asked. Kylar looked at the stallion before shaking his mane out his chains chinking as he did. \"Morning, Samuelson. Hours, I rise with the sun.\" He replied smiling in a friendly manner. Samuelson was busy watching his chain sway under his stomach. \"May I ask why you have it?\" Samuelson asked looking at Kylar's face. Kylar chuckled he knew eventually the stud would ask. His attention was caught by Kareem coming over to join them yawning.\n\"I got it as a foal my parents thought it was cool. Now I'm used to it.\" Kylar explained shrugging, of course he didn't tell them the whole story about how his parents did it to use it as a tool to yank him around by. Luckily the two studs let it go. \"Where should we head?\" Kareem asked looking at Samuelson before looking at Kylar questioningly. Samuelson looked at Kylar too for answers. \"Let's head into the forest, I'm not sure what all there is to see I've only been in the herd for a few months so it'll be new for me too, you guys lead the way I'll take up the rear.\" Kylar said smiling at them.\nThey nodded and began walking towards the treeline Kylar right behind them, secretly checking out their backsides with a smirk on his lips. As the vented into the forest the sounds of birds chirping could be heard all around them it was a rather warm day and it instantly put the blue roan in a good mood.\nAs the walked around the hidden island there were many hills and rocky ledges to master and by the time they had ended up where they began the sun had dropped well below the horizon so each stallion laid down for yet another night then in the morning Kylar would be able to get their answers. He hoped they agreed to join him, he had gotten to know them quite a bit on the exploration, it was nice being around another pair of such nice horses sense the only horses around here were more on the aggressive side. Though none were evil they took care of each other and respected each other that was why Kylar loved it. He knew he belonged here, his love of pain and giving pain had him fitting in for the most part even if some thought he was too nice, he didn't care he would protect anyone with his life like how his parents should have protected him. He wouldn't let anyone feel what he had felt all his young life.",

    "context": "\u201cTHREE BALD EAGLES ON A NEST\u201d\nI\u2019ve been watching these three since they hatched and it was from a friend that I found out about them\u2014for these eagles are on UStream in Decorah, Iowa and it\u2019s online. The web cam was put there by Bob Anderson for his job is observing bald eagles; he not only observes but operates the web cam at times and records data. This is his project and he graciously let us in to watch.\nImagine watching them closely as they are 80 feet up in the air on their nest: It\u2019s an experience that over 100 million have witnessed. These three \u201cjuvies\u201d have the best parents ever: They are diligent, caring and would give their lives for their babies if they had to. On chat, I have learned just about every term that applies to bald eagles from \u201cmantling\u201d to a \u201cnicitating\u201d eye lid.\nNo doubt some people don\u2019t watch this and they have missed the experience of a lifetime for it is as like watching young babies with their parents: There is the desire on the babies\u2019 part to be snuggled, fed and cared for. Week by week they have become observant of their surroundings and are curious. And week by week, you can see the change in their faces\u2014for they are on the nest with no where to go and they are becoming more curious every day. Their wings have grown from almost nothing to a wing span of five feet. They flap their wings, hop and sleep a lot. Sleep comes after they have been fed fish or some animals by their parents and this produces a \u201cfood coma.\u201d\nFirst mom and dad fed each eaglet by mouth with tiny pieces of fish; this went on for weeks and weeks. At this point, dad drops off a fish and there is a scramble among the three to retrieve and eat the fish. And usually one gets it and eats it whole! Meanwhile, the other two look up in desperation for dad to drop off more fish and he always does. If one \u201cjuvie\u201d doesn\u2019t get any fish, dad makes sure to feed it himself, sometimes taking bites for himself.\nDuring all kinds of weather from snow at the beginning of their birth to pouring rain this past week, mom and dad have protected these three. Usually it\u2019s mom who stays with them during inclement weather and prior, she had stretched out her wings for coverage. But now the juvies are too big to fit underneath mom and so one or two will stick its head underneath her feathers. First of the week, it was pouring the rain and there stood mom getting drenched [but her feathers are waterproof as are all full grown bald eagles as well as the juvies now] but determined to keep her babies safe.\nThe juvies are hopping high and exercising their huge wings at this point\u2014sometimes hitting another one in the face while doing so. The nest is over six feet wide and it\u2019s getting crowded now and more so when mom and dad join them. Rest assured that the nest is strong as it weighs about one thousand pounds and is 80 feet up in a cottonwood tree! And day and night, mom and dad are always close by in another tree: They do not leave these babies alone. But they are letting them sleep alone more now so that they will become independent\u2014for that is how nature is.\nAs a watcher [along with millions] it is so hilarious to see a juvie see itself in the metal casing of the web cam! One will stare and stare and you can come to believe that it is staring at you: The camera is that close. And what faces they have\u2014so inquisitive and so cute.\nBy the fourth of July or maybe sooner, they will start to fledge and that means flying. But first they will do branching which means that they will jump from branch to branch first before they get their wings ready for a real flight. And no, they will not resemble their parents for they won\u2019t get their white heads, yellow beaks or yellow eyes till they are four or five years old.\nFor the millions of us watching this unbelievable experience, it is a once in a lifetime chance to witness the birth and growth of these three bald eagles as well as their caring and beautiful parents.\nRob McIntyre, the president of Raptor Resoure Project, passed away while attempting to help a neighbor in Minnesota after the horrible tornado. He suffered a fatal heart attack. And his passing created a huge void with those he was associated with in the project. Didn\u2019t know him but had seen his photos and information on the Raptor Resource Project home page online and he had spent his life working with bald eagles.\nRest assured that when these three juvie bald eagles take off, Rob\u2019s spirit will be flying with them in the form of an eagle: How could it not?\nI\u2019d like to thank everyone including RRP and UStream for providing this unique experience for letting us all be right there in the nest\u2014even if we are looking at it on a computer monitor. I\u2019ve learned so much, witnessed so much and laughed when chatters write a post till I think that I am definitely an \u201ceagleholic:\u201d No, I don\u2019t think it. I know I am one. Kudos to the moderators who selfishly are giving their time to keep order and civility on the live chat: You guys rock. And kudos to Bob Anderson who has panned the camera so much so that we can get views that are breathtaking.\nIf you\u2019re out and about, don\u2019t look down. Look up! You may just catch the site of a bald eagle soaring above you and you will be witnessing a miracle in feathers. This raptor is the top of the food chain with only man being its enemy\u2014they are nationally protected by law. And well they should be. And also well that they are our national symbol\u2014freedom, strength and majesty is what America stands for and so does the bald eagle.\nSherry Hill",

    "context": "BACKGROUND\nBishop Heber High School is situated in the village of Malpas, serving students across South West Cheshire. The school currently has 1,000 pupils and\nprovides a safe and caring environment, through which it encourages respect, opportunity and achievement. Being at the forefront of technology provision for both staff and students plays a key part in helping the school achieve its vision, along with an understanding of the technical requirements to help everything run smoothly.\nPROBLEM/OBJECTIVE\nLike many other secondary schools across the country, Bishop Heber was keen to embrace new ways for teachers to deliver content to students, making lessons more engaging and informative. As such, presentations were becoming more multimedia-based, using video clips and online content. Storage of these large files (some up to 50MB each) was putting a huge strain on the existing data storage system, which was made up of plug-in USB drives and was fast reaching capacity. The way in which files were shared between teachers also needed reviewing, with staff using USB pens and laptops to store their presentations and emailing the large files to colleagues.\nIn addition, the school has also seen a big rise in the amount of other forms of data it needs to manage,\nincluding emails and media streaming. The resilience of the storage was also a cause for concern in the ICT\ndepartment, with no back-up in place should servers (and disks) fail. Physical space and budget was also\nat a premium, so the department was reluctant to bolt on any more USB storage devices.\nSOLUTION\nThe school needed a more cost-effective, scalable solution to meet its ever expanding storage needs. Through IT partner i7 Technologies Limited, Gary Naylor \u2013 ICT network and SIMS manager at Bishop Heber High School \u2013 looked into the options for a more resilient SAN solution. Already a trusted partner for networking and wireless support, the school selected to work with NETGEAR for the upgrade. To ensure the right solution was put in place, i7 Technologies arranged for NETGEAR to conduct a site survey to assess storage needs. Gary also needed to get buy-in from senior management to overhaul the system, with many questioning why using more plug-in devices was not an option. NETGEAR recommended its ReadyDATA 5200 product with a 180TB capacity and deduplication features. As part of the process, NETGEAR brought in a device to show Gary exactly how it worked and what he was getting for his money, so he was able to see how it would provide real value for the school and grow with its needs.\nThe ReadyDATA 5200 not only provided all of the functionality that Gary needed, but was a more cost-effective option than the Fujitsu and HP storage the school previously used, giving him the ammunition needed to get management go-ahead. Throughout the transition to the new system, NETGEAR staff were on-hand to provide support and manage any initial teething problems, with all queries and issues resolved within 24 hours\nRESULTS\nWith the school\u2019s storage needs rising from 1TB 6 years ago to 7TB today, the NETGEAR solution provides more than enough capacity to meet the school\u2019s needs now and in the future. Back-ups are now happening more quickly and files are able to be restored with ease if accidentally deleted, without having to go through the back-up software. Staff can easily save and share data rather than having to email or transfer files via USB pens. Gary and his team now have more time to focus on other aspects of their role instead of spending hours scanning and deleting duplicate files to free up space on the server. The deduplication facility means that this now happens automatically, and all that is needed is an occasional scan and delete of files that shouldn\u2019t be saved on the school system. Moving forward, the school is looking to add another ReadyDATA unit, so the two can mirror each other and provide backup in the event of a technical issue or access problem. It also plans to work with NETGEAR to upgrade its wireless network and improve performance across all buildings on the school site.\nThe complete case study produced by Netgear can be found on the Netgear Website LINK",

    "context": "Written by: Stephen Spyropoulos\nPhotography by: Stephen Spyropoulos\nBuying your first car is a significant milestone in your life, one that you will never forget. After passing your G2 license exam, gearheads that are lucky enough are often graced with a hand-me-down family vehicle, a used car off Kijiji, or maybe even a set of keys to a brand spanking new Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or any other entry-level vehicle. And now there\u2019s a newcomer to that segment, the brand new Scion iM.\nWhen Scion announced the arrival of the iM model to North American shores I could not help but notice that the car looked strangely familiar, like a friend you haven\u2019t seen since the third grade. You knew his or her face, but you could never put a name to it. So I pulled out the Toyota yearbook and began searching. Lo and behold, the truth was revealed. The Scion iM is a Toyota Auris in disguise! The exterior shell, inner workings, and chassis all came from its Corolla-derived Japanese hatchback counterpart. No wonder.\nThis design has been around since 2012 and staying true to Toyota fashion, it shares the same 1.8-litre 2ZR-FAE engine that has been around since 2009. There is a reason why Toyota builds some of the most reliable products on the market, and that\u2019s because they\u2019ve been refining the same platforms for years on end. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, would this car be ready to compete in 2016 or would it feel a bit long in the tooth?\nThe Scion iM comes from the side of Toyota that we are not accustomed to seeing. The iM\u2019s ripped-straight-out-of-Japan styling brings back memories of to the Scion xB when it first hit the market by storm in 2004. But instead of the xB\u2019s controversial boxy look and appeal, the iM poses as a conventional hatchback with a factory body kit, a lowered suspension, a polarizing paint job, cool looking wheels, and an interior that looks like it had a bout with an aftermarket tuner shop. This car was clearly developed during the import-tuner craze of The Fast and Furious days, \u201ciM ready for Importfest!\u201d\nYet, I wonder why Toyota did not choose to use a more potent powerplant in the iM. Mated with a 4-cylinder 1.8-litre motor that delivers 137 hp and 126 lb-ft of torque, it takes a lengthy 8.6 seconds to get from 0 to 100 km/h. The power, or the lack of it, was perhaps the most prevalent and disappointing feature of this car. While at low speeds I had to give props for the Scion\u2019s go-kart-like handling, rapid turn-ins, and peppy throttle response, the lack of oomph kept creeping back into reality.\nHowever, fuel economy was ace thanks to the iM\u2019s small engine, Eco Mode, and feathery 1,334 kg curb weight. Over the week I managed an average of 8.3 L/100km \u2013 not bad!\nThere are two transmission options available, a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission ($825), the latter of which was equipped on our tester. Take our advice and skip the CVT. The manual will supplement the otherwise innocuous driving experience with a few doses of driver engagement.\nDue to the lowered suspension the car feels quite harsh over rough terrain. As we have seen in other Scions like the FR-S, handling is sporty and captivating, the chassis is brilliant, but as an overall package, it leaves much to be desired. Untapped potential? Perhaps. But there\u2019s certainly no harm in a little extra power.\nI liked the simplicity inside the iM: few buttons and a minimalistic design. While it did feel like the infotainment system could have used a few more knobs, the system was decent and includes USB, auxiliary, and Bluetooth capability. The seats were comfortable, though a bit snug in legroom and cargo space.\nThe Scion iM is entering the most competitive era of hot hatchbacks since the 80s and if it doesn\u2019t come out swinging, it will drown in the competition. As tested, our Barcelona Red iM hangs around $21,990. At this quite attractive price point, I can understand that some sacrifices had to be made, but I feel like a more powerful engine matched with a sportier setup would attract the younger audience that Scion is aiming at.\nWhile the force isn\u2019t particularly strong with the iM, it does have potential. Scion has given customers a blank canvas and like the FR-S, the iM may need a helping hand from aftermarket enthusiasts. Considering the target age and the current incentives for school graduates, the iM makes for an excellent first car. It is very simple to drive and does not have the power to scare the daylights out of any rookie buyers. Though I\u2019d have a hard time recommending the iM, it does make its case with Toyota\u2019s renowned history of quality and reliability.\nPhoto Gallery:\n\u578b\u53f7 Model: 2016 Scion iM\n\u984f\u8272 Paint Type: Barcelona Red Metallic\n\u5ee0\u65b9\u5efa\u8b70\u552e\u50f9 Base Price: $21,165\n\u8a66\u8eca\u552e\u50f9 Price as Tested: $21,990\n\u8ef8\u8ddd Wheelbase(mm): 2,600\n\u9577\u95ca Length/Width/Height (mm): 4,330 / 1,760 / 1,405\n\u8eca\u91cd Curb weight (kg): 1,335\n\u5f15\u64ce Engine: 1.8L 4-cylinder\n\u6700\u5927\u99ac\u529b Horsepower: 137 hp @ 6,100 rpm\n\u6700\u9ad8\u626d\u529b Torque: 126 lb-ft @ 4,000 rpm\n\u6ce2\u7bb1 Transmission: CVT ($825)\n\u64fa\u4f48 Engine & Drive Configuration: Front engine, FWD\n\u524d\u61f8 Suspension-Front: MacPherson strut\n\u5f8c\u61f8 Suspension-Rear: Double wishbone\n\u6cb9\u8017 Fuel Consumption ( City / Highway / Combined ) L/100km: 8.3 / 6.3 / 7.4\n\u6cb9\u8017 Observed Fuel Consumption (L/100km): 8.3\n\u8f2a\u80ce\u5c3a\u78bc Tires: P225/45R17",

    "context": "Imagine a person sitting down to eat dinner. Their partner pours a glass of tea. Their child reaches for a napkin. Just as this person picks up their fork and knife to cut a piece of stake a flash-bang grenade burst through the families front window. Before anyone has e a chance to realize what happened local police dressed in war ready full military gear kick down the front door. An officer screams \u201cSit down and shut up!\u201d In 1969 a group that was considered \u201cthe greatest threat to the internal security of the country\u201d by J. Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations got the shock of their life. Members of the Black Panther Party were the first to experience militarization of police in the form of a SWAT raid. The United States had decided to begin using military style weapons and war tactics on its own citizen. The raid was largely considered a disaster and resulted in the Black Panther Party member being acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Fast forward to 2014 and this militarization policing has become all too common.\nFrequently military style police raids are carried out on local citizens resulting in the wrong doors kicked in and innocent people hurt. Just this May one-year-old Bounkham Phonesavanh had to be placed in a medical induced coma. Using a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant Police tossed a stun grenade into his play pen as he slept, to gain entry into his family\u2019s home. The raid resulted in no arrest and no drugs were found.\nWhat is perhaps most concerning is the law does not protect from police militarization. It actually empowers it. In the 1980\u2019s president Ronald Reagan introduced a series of anti-drug laws, commonly known as the Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Statute. This law was aimed at providing military like training and weapons to domestic police to prevent drug smuggling across U.S. borders. Despite many concerns that this new law violated civil liberties protected under the Bill of Rights, budgets for police militarization have exploded over the years.\nSWAT teams carry huge monetary incentives for police departments. Anti-drug laws do not require the destruction of money and property seized during the raids. Instead, confiscated items are used to further gear up against the war on drugs. Three billion dollars a year are allotted to local police for military like equipment such as Lenco BearCats. The Department of Homeland security feels that the bullet proof war tank is necessary for local police units.\nMilitarized SWAT teams have increased by the thousands over the past few decades despite violent drug related crimes decreasing. As a result of their, at times, reckless expenditures, dozens of stories where average citizens lives are changed forever continue to emerge. Some have challenged the laws and the behavior of local police citing violation of their fourth amendment rights or excessive force. When Bounkham\u2019s mother tried to check on him according to her she was told \u201csit down and shut up!\u201d That seems to be the court\u2019s attitude toward victims. In the case of 18-year-old Esequiel Hernandez Jr, Marine Cpl., Clemente Banuelos shot him to death as he herded sheep near his home. Cpl. Banuelos was a part of anti-drug border patrol operations. He was acquitted of any charges.\nIn these cases rarely do local police suffer any type of legal repercussions for treating their local jurisdictions like military war zones. Police often defend their actions. Militarization of local police has become the norm giving them increasing power to kick down your front door. The reason, all too often is to simply serve a search warrant for a misdemeanor crime. Perhaps President Reagan\u2019s Assistant Secretary of Defense, Lawrence Korb, put it best when he said \u201cSoldiers are trained to \u201cvaporize, not Mirandize\u201d\nBy Ashley Poag\nSources:\nPacific Standard Magazine\nForbes\nSalon\nNational Drug Strategy Network\nCASE POINT: EXCUSE ME Hum -Ah \u2026 MR.

    "context": "Getting started with a blog for your business is a worthwhile use of your time and effort. Choosing a blogging platform is the first step in getting started. I highly recommend that you go with a \u2018hosted\u2019 site, rather than one that is on a free platform. The one used by the majority of people working online is WordPress.org.\nThe hosted option eliminates the hassle of finding a host for your blog as the company takes care of that for you. This option would cost you a monthly or annual fee. I\u2019ve used both Blue Host and Host Gator to host my WordPress sites, but have now switched over to Liquid Web for all of my blog hosting because of recent changes in service and performance with those larger companies.\nWhat you want to completely avoid is a free blogging platform, such as WordPress.com, Tumblr.com, or Blogger.com. I compare this to setting up a lemonade stand on the corner as opposed to leasing a space in the mall. You\u2019re setting up a blog for your business, not for a hobby that may go by the wayside in the future.\nWordPress.org is the other blog platform you should know, which is a standalone option. If you are already hosting some of your websites with a web host, WordPress.org is ideal for you. Not only is WordPress.org free for unlimited use, but it is the best-supported blog platform there is. For ultimate control of your blog, this is as good as it gets. It is the blog platform of choice of today\u2019s savviest bloggers.\nVisit the sites I\u2019ve mentioned above and if you\u2019re going for the hosted option, simply sign-up for an account and you\u2019ll be ready to start blogging immediately. It\u2019s truly a simple process to set up WordPress through your hosting account, and they will be happy to help you to do it quickly and easily.\nChoosing a Name for Your Blog\nIf you already own a website, you understand the significance of choosing a good domain name. A good domain name not only enhances the branding of your business and makes it easy for your readers to share with others.\nIf your blog is going to play a significant role in your business, then spend some time choosing the right domain name for it. People tend to remember memorable domain names that end with a dot com to spread it around easier. I recommend using GoDaddy as the registrar for all of your domains. I currently own almost six hundred domains and appreciate how they are handled through this company.\nChoosing a Template / Theme for Your Blog\nWith the free platforms like Blogger.com and WordPress.com, the need to hire a Web designer is eliminated. These options already have blog templates (often called \u201cthemes\u201d) ready for use. Just pick a design that works well with the theme of your business and get ready to start blogging. The downside to this is that there is only so much you can do to alter its look and feel. What you see is what you get.\nWith WordPress.org however, you\u2019re free to hire a Web Designer to design the style of your blog from the ground up. There are no limitations to what you can do with your design. There are WordPress.org templates that are also freely given away by the WordPress community with no strings attached. You have full rights to grab any of these templates and alter them to suit the theme of your business blog. If you need a recommendation for someone to help you set up a WordPress blog that\u2019s exactly what you are thinking of, contact me and I\u2019ll give you some names of the people that have helped me with my sites.\nYou can search on Google \u201cWordpress themes\u201d and you\u2019ll get a variety of sites to choose from. One of the more popular ones is found at.\nHi Connie, I\u2019m going to switch to liquidweb real soon. Hostgator can no longer support my VPS to the quality of support I need.\nI just started blogging for my business. I like to think I know a fair bit about WordPress though as I\u2019ve had sites before and I have even designed themes\u2026\nThere has been debate over free themes. I think if you a) get them from the WordPress.org site or b) from a recommendation of an authority; you are safe. If you just Google on, there is a chance there might be a nasty script hidden inside lol.\nMark Hunter recently posted\u2026Do 5-Star Ratings Make Good Plugins\nI couldn\u2019t agree more Connie!\nWordPress.org is definitely the way to go,\nwith regards to using a professional, self hosted blogging platform.\nAnd like you pointed out, if need be, you can always hire a professional web designer, if you want or need a premium theme customized.Thanks for sharing some extremely practical information.\nMark recently posted\u2026How Extremely Savvy Entrepreneurs Make Money In The Information Business Without A Product!",

Porridge with raspberries, walnuts and agave. I used rice milk which I really like at the moment- it's by Vitasoy and I thought it was interesting that it's enriched with calcium from chickpeas! I also find the taste of the rice milk really palatable early in the morning- sometimes the smell of cows milk and even soy milk can be really off-putting I find.\nOn Friday morning I finally bought ballet shoes :) I feel like I'm six again!\nThen in the afternoon A and I saw the movie 'The Trip' in Leichhardt, which was a lot funnier than expected! We had gelato beforehand and I thought this photo was particularly attractive (sorry A...)\nOn Saturday morning I got a lift to Rozelle, walked around for a bit then wandered around the markets. Being cold I almost bought a cardigan but when the sun came out there was no need. I did end up buying these shoes though which fit perfectly!\nI made these carrot muffins when I came back from the markets, this time using soy milk instead of cows, using brazil nuts instead of walnuts and sprinkling chia seeds on top. I'll admit they weren't as nice as when I previously made them- but certainly that extra bit healthier ;)\nOn Sunday we celebrated my Grandma's birthday at our house with family, which meant a lot of cooking (and washing up!) in the morning. My uncle made these delicious spring rolls with a dipping sauce made of coconut milk, lime juice, fish sauce and chilli!\nWhat I had for lunch: lots of roast veges, salad, pesto pasta (which I made!) and vegetarian biryani.\nAnd for dessert apart from cake we made these baked apples, a recipe courtesy of Sophie Dahl. We'd never made them before and were impressed with how they turned out! The only criticism was a few sultanas on top were burnt, but oh well.\nAnd that was my weekend! Let's hope this gorgeous sunshine continues :) :)\nHave a fab week!\nHannah x\nI find rice milk to be a little sweet tasting - which works really well for porridge!\nAll that food looks absolutely divine - baked apples, yum!

The event was connected to the Swedish Institute global expo \u201dLife Puzzle\u201d, like in the other countries where I\u2019ve been invited to talk about the ParentSmart Company initiative. The seminar was very well arranged by the Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs, the Embassy of Sweden, the Swedish Institute, the Responsible Business Forum and support from Norway Grants. Perfect timing for the theme too \u2013 2 days after presentation of the new Parliament, and one of it\u2019s prioritized questions: Work-Life Balance!\nThe seminar at Radisson Blu Hotel Ol\u00fcmpia attracted Estonian companies from various business areas, and although female dominance there were both women and men in the audience. During the day we got current reports about challenges, possibilities and intiatives going on in the country, as well as Estonian research within the area and a Norwegian case about Storebrand\u2019s activities to be an attractive employer.\nI had the pleasure to lead a 1,5 h interactive workshop with the audience (in Estonian \u2013 it worked \u2013 well! :-)) \u2013 a dialogue about how to make use of ALL the competence available to a company \u2013 and thereby increasing gender equality, work-life balance etc. We talked about how the ParentSmart Company initiative helps companies see and show why parents are a valuable asset to the company, and why it\u2019s profitable to have both mothers and fathers on parental leave. And how the process is initiated in practise, to achieve concrete and quick results.\nThe participants reflected together about their ideas, thoughts, doubts and convictions. The room was full of energy \u2013 it was interesting to follow the exchange of ideas and experiences within the area, current to all. The ParentSmart opportunity is there, in these Estonian companies like in all others I\u2019ve met \u2013 since company benefits from parenthood always have been there. The step for an employer to show they know this connection isn\u2019t that big, but makes all the difference. And results come quickly if working with practical support, attitudes and role models at the same time.\nBelow: The Swedish Ambassador Anders Ljunggren and Katri Eespere, from the Ministry of Social Affairs. Estonia has a very generous parental leave law, and several projects going on in the area. The Ministry supports initiatives in companies in different ways, both with ideas and financially (funds from Norway and EU for ex). Katri is responsible for gender equality questions at the Ministry and was showing a genuine and inspiring optimism towards the future. She talks about the gender equality development not seen as a problem, but as an interesting challenge. Liked that attitude.\nTriin Roosalu from Tallinn University presented research and ideas under the theme \u201cForming (gender) identities through time management\u201d. She had an interesting reasoning about what really causes gender equality/inequality, and how we add to it and not in society, through attitudes, behaviors and role models.\nBeside the Life Puzzle expo below: our excellent moderator Lee Maripuu from Swedbank, and my great support with everything from translation of slides into Estonian to expertise in the topic area \u2013 Karel Parve, Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs.\nI look forward to continue my good contacts in Estonia, and hopefully be able to follow the development further in Estonian companies and society.\nBra jobbat Tiina!\n/Emilia",

    "context": "It's noon on Friday, and Z's Fish & Shrimp on Lincoln near Belden is packed to the gills. Hospital workers in scrubs and kids from Lincoln Park High School wait for takeout. A lone salesman sits in the window eating fried jumbo shrimp. Next to him, Audrey Starks and her daughter Gwen eat fried chicken and split a plate of hush puppies. And in the back, 85-year-old Ples Farrow is deveining shrimp. Farrow--who will probably clean 600 shrimp today, as well as answer the phone and take orders--has worked as a fish cutter and butcher since the Great Depression. He works Fridays only, and every week his boss, Scott Zells, drives him back and forth from his south-side home.\nNobody in Z's looks upset about being squeezed in--except for maybe his good-sport mother, Myra, who is helping out during the crunch, manning the cash register with one hand and taking call-in orders with the other. It's a far cry from her regular job, doing special events for MK and MK North. Her son, the 35-year-old proprietor, is wearing a doo-rag and a bright blue T-shirt, smiling and trying to keep it together.\nIt took guts for Zells to open his tiny shop on a street that's already packed with other options for a quick meal. \"Look at what's around me,\" he says, ticking off Domino's, Subway, Quiznos, Potbelly, Chipotle, McDonald's, and Jimmy John's. But Zells has always worked in fast food: at 14 he was dipping ice cream cones at Swensen's, at 16 slinging hot dogs at Fluky's. He studied restaurant management briefly at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (though he graduated with a degree in communications), and his first few management jobs were at the Hunt Club and Joe's Sports Bar.\nHis fascination with fish started in 1999, when State Fish Distributors, a fish market located near the old stockyards, brought him in to help open the nearby Danny's Fish Market, which sold cooked fish to take out as well as fresh seafood. There he met Farrow, who had retired from State Fish ten years earlier. He'd been lured back to work at Danny's two or three days a week, says Zells, \"due to his expertise and general demeanor.\"\nWhen Danny's closed two and a half years later, Zells was determined to open his own place. Originally he'd thought of a little hot-dog-and-hamburger stand, but he knew Lincoln Park had nothing like the fish-fry places dotting the south side. He found a 640-square-foot space down the street from Children's Hospital, painted the facade a screaming shade of blue, then commissioned \"sign painter extraordinaire\" Ernie of R and G Signs to decorate it with cartoon images of a smiling ear of corn, a dancing fish, and waving cheese fries. Farrow, fish cutter Grover Jefferson, and Z's four other employees all worked at Danny's.\nZ's sells hundreds of pounds of seafood a week, Zells says, all brought in from State Fish. A small charbroiler grills up salmon, tilapia, tuna, shrimp, catfish, and scallops, all served four ways: sauced with teriyaki or honey dijon, seasoned with lemon pepper, or blackened. Fried options include fish, chicken, scallops, and shrimp (served without the tail). There are steamed vegetables and corn on the cob, plus french fries, hush puppies, mac 'n' cheese, fried okra, and onion rings. Catfish, fish-and-chips, and shrimp are available by the quarter, half, and full pound. Desserts include banana or Oreo pudding, coconut cake, and fried Twinkies.\nSince the restaurant opened in May 2002, Zells has had no time for vacations or much of a social life. But he does find time for good works. He picks up garbage on the street after Z's closes and before it opens in the morning. He takes out his neighbor's garbage. He gives discounts to Children's Hospital employees and to parents of patients. Kids get free candy (\"As a kid, I loved that gum shaped like little hot dogs, so I got the kids a little Swedish candy shaped like a fish\"). And when one of his employees recently had an automobile accident, Zells bought him a recliner.\nThere are no tables at Z's, but customers can sit by the window on high stools, watching life drift by, surrounded by the collection of fish tchotchkes Zells has gathered from thrift stores and prop houses. On Fridays they can also chat with Farrow, who, when he isn't working at Z's, relaxes at home and does yard work. His wife of 55 years, Bessie, died two and a half years ago. \"She was my right arm, my wife, my friend, my companion, my everything,\" he says. He smiles, thinking of his wife, then turns to talking about Zells. \"He has a heart in him. He doesn't have to give me a job. He's really a wonderful man.\"\n\"He's my icon,\" Zells says of Farrow. \"He's been in fish for longer than I've been around.\"\nZ's Fish & Shrimp is at 2273 N. Lincoln, 773-525-6000.\nArt accompanying story in printed newspaper (not available in this archive): photo/Cynthia Howe.",

    "context": "During Christmas season, the popular cake/ bread that is ordered from bakeries in Sri Lanka is the breuder. This is a speciality of the Burgher cuisine of Sri Lanka. I had been trying for some time to find someone to contribute a home-made recipe of this delicious bread. I was delighted to finally come across another blogger and invited him to share his family recipe on this blog as well. Here is the guest post of Paul van Reyk, from My Buth Kuddeh food site, with his introduction to his family tradition of baking breuder and his recipe. Wishing you all a merry Christmas!\nNo Christmas at our house in Sri Lanka was complete without my grandmother\u2019s breuder. It\u2019s basically a cakey bread, based on a yeasted dough but with the sweetness of a sponge cake, related to Italian pannetone. It\u2019s a direct entry into Sri Lanka cuisine via the Dutch Broodtulband named for the fluted \u2018turban\u2019 shaped mould used to make it. Further embedding the Dutch connection, brueder is traditionally eaten in Sri Lankan Burgher households in slices covered in butter and topped with a thick slice of Edam cheese. There is something very festive about that red waxy ball which sliced open reveals a pale European sun yellow cheese. Making the breuder, I am transported back to the kitchen of my childhood, watching my grandmother knead the dough, having the thrill of buttering the mould and pressing sultanas against the sides anxious that they stay in place, full of expectation as it was taken to my uncles house across the road as we didn\u2019t have an oven, and then the excitement of un-moulding this magical transformation of so few ingredients hoping desperately that it comes away cleanly. The smile on grannie\u2019s face when it does was more rewarding almost than the first bite into its soft, crumby heart.\nBreuder\nIngredients:\n- 500gms plain flour\n- 50 gms butter\n- baker\u2019s yeast\n- 1 tsp sugar\n- water\n- 6 egg yolks\n- 250 gms caster sugar\n- 125 gms currants or sultanas or raisins or a mixture of them\nMethod:\n- Make the dough the night before. Take as much yeast as is recommended for your particular yeast for making bread with 500 gms of flour (it can vary so read the packet or ask when you buy it), add the yeast and the sugar to a little hot water to get the yeast started. It will froth slightly. When it\u2019s bubbling happily, add this to the flour and mix in well. Now slowly add water and keep mixing until you have a lump of dough that lifts easily out of the bowl or off the board. Knead it for 10 minutes or so. Put it in a bowl, cover the bowl with a damp tea-towel and leave it in a warm place to rise overnight.\n- The next day, take the dough and add to it the butter, egg yolks and sugar. Add the first three yolks separately and mix in well each time. Then add the others also one at a time alternating with dollops of the caster sugar till it is all used up. What you will have now is a very thick wet doughy batter.\n- Butter a turban mould. Put a good sprinkle of whatever dried fruit you are using on the bottom. Squish some dried fruit against the sides of the mould, too. Pour in the batter. Sprinkle more of the dried fruit on top of the batter. If you like, and I do, you can mix some dried fruits into the batter, too.\n- Leave this in a warm place, the mould covered with a damp cloth, for 1 or 2 hours until it rises again (it won\u2019t rise as much as the dough did overnight).\n- Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to very hot \u2013 around 220C.\n- When the dough has risen the second time, put the mould in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Check at that stage that the breuder is cooked by poking a bamboo skewer or similar into the dough. If it comes out clean, your breuder is ready. If it doesn\u2019t, give the breuder 10 \u2013 15 minutes more.\nTip: Putting some baking/greaseproof/brown paper on the top will reduce the likelihood of the dried fruit burning.\n- When it\u2019s cooked, take it out of the oven and leave it to cool in the mould. You should then be able to give the mould a good thump and have the brooder come cleanly out of it.\nResist all temptation to ice or otherwise muck around with the breuder! Just slice it up and have some butter and Edam or cheddar cheese to have it with. But you are allowed to make summer pudding with the left over breuder if you like, or indeed any of those bread pudding dishes.\nRecipe source: Paul van Reyk",

    "context": "You likely won\u2019t have to go carpet shopping too many times during your lifetime. If you do, and if you do it right, you might find yourself having purchased a quality carpet that suits your lifestyle so much that you won\u2019t have to replace it for a very long time. With proper maintenance and cleaning, you can double your carpet\u2019s life and make it last for years, making that first shopping trip well worth the effort of proper preparation and consideration before making that purchase.\nFactor in the Household Lifestyle\nSo, what do you look for when shopping for a new carpet? A lot of it has to do with your lifestyle. Do you belong to a large family with kids, pets, and a lot of foot traffic, fur and potential dirty stains getting on your carpet? Stick to a neutral color, a carpet that can withstand a lot of wear and tear, and one that is easy to clean.\nOn the other hand, if you are living a single lifestyle, in an apartment you have all to yourself, you can probably afford to look at more showy carpets. Just remember to keep in mind the potential stains and dirt you might end up spilling on the carpet, and purchase according to the ease of cleaning. You\u2019ll save yourself a lot of aggravation in the long run if you keep these things in mind.\nGo for Quality Each Time\nNot all carpets are of the same fiber, even though they may look alike. And while all the different factors that you have to consider when shopping for a carpet might make the process more confusing to some, a careful consideration of each one of them, and all of them taken together will go a long way in the kind of purchase decision you make.\nAs an overview, remember to ask about carpet density, fiber twist, and the type of fiber used in the carpets. And don\u2019t forget about the carpet\u2019s face weight, which is the weight of the carpet pile per square yard, which goes a long way to determine how tough and sturdy your carpet is.\nThere are also different styles of carpet, and depending on your lifestyle, you can select from a wide variety of them: berber, frieze, Saxony, for instance, which are the most common.\nRemember the Underpad\nThis is the lesser-known side of the carpet, and the side that is less visible. So, you might be wondering what makes the underpad so important that you need to factor it into your carpet buying process?\nWell, the underpad can go a long way in determining your carpet\u2019s lifespan. The thicker the underpad, the better able your carpet is to withstand all the foot traffic and other wear and tear that comes from having carpet that constantly treads upon. So, if you want your carpet to last long, don\u2019t skimp on the underpad. Not only will this minimize the wear and tear on your carpet, but it also feels very comfortable, too.\nHave a Professional install your Carpet\nWhen you purchase a new carpet, you will also have to hire the services of a professional in installing the carpets. Sure, you can try to do it yourself, but \u2013 and this is especially true if you are attempting to cover a large floor area with irregular corners, you might find that it\u2019s cheaper to just hire others to do the work for you.\nThis is because there are a lot of things to factor in during installation, as well: carpet measurements and cutting, upholstery work on your stairs or railings, and having the proper kind of installation that warranties stipulate.\nYes, carpet warranties may require that your carpet be professionally installed, otherwise the warranty is voided. This is because carpet manufacturers who do offer these warranties know that the carpet\u2019s life may also be directly dependent on how it is first installed in your home. Poor installation can lead to rips, loose carpeting, and unsightly flooring. If you are carpeting a particularly wide floor area, the work of installation itself might be so prohibitive that it would be cheaper for you, not just in terms of money but also in terms of resources, expertise, and energy investment to hire professionals rather than doing all the work yourself. Atlanta Carpet Cleaning Care \u2013 a company who does carpet cleaning professionally have access to appropriate tools that can do the job more thoroughly and a whole lot easier than if you did it yourself. So, save yourself a headache and leave the installation of that new and expensive carpet to the professionals.",

    "answer": "When shopping for a new carpet, one should consider their household lifestyle, the quality of the carpet including its density, fiber twist, and the type of fiber used, the carpet's face weight, the style of the carpet, the underpad of the carpet, and the need for professional installation.",

But my baby cat has never been one to do things by the book and that\u2019s not what happened.\nI should have gone yesterday. I could tell that he was ready, but I put it off so Adorabeezle could come with me. I knew I needed someone with me, but I wish I had been stronger. This morning I woke up to the most horrible noise I\u2019ve ever heard. It was a struggle for him, and I began praying fervently that the Lord would just take him. About half an hour later he died in my arms. He did no go peacefully, and I did it alone.\nIt was awful. Yet I am relieved. I\u2019m relieved he is no longer suffering. I\u2019m relieved that he won\u2019t need to take any more pills that he hates. I\u2019m relieved that he doesn\u2019t have to fight for his life anymore.\nRight under that relief, I am devastated and the tears will come. But if nothing else, throughout his entire life, this cat has taught me that I am strong. That I can face what I don\u2019t think I can handle. That I can do things I never thought I could. Binx saw me through a lot in a few short years and I will miss him terribly. It was a honor to call myself his mama, and I will always love him.\nI apologize for my continued absence. I will be mourning and moving over the next few days. I will be back, Internet, but until then please remember my baby.\nI am so sorry to hear about Binx. And I am so sorry you had to go through those painful last moments, but you were there for him. He died in the arms of the person he loved best and he didn\u2019t have to pass away alone.

    "context": "Gratitude is something you show in relation to others. Dalai Lama?\nGratitude has been associated with increased resilience to trauma, closer interpersonal relationships and a general sense of enhanced psychological wellbeing.\nThe expression of gratitude may serve to communicate reciprocal engagement and to prevent being seen as \u201cfree-loader\u201d which could end in social punishment.\nGratitude signals to society that a grateful person is fair and motivates prosocial behavior in the future. Gratitude felt may be small (holding a door for someone) or enormous (donating an organ). It can be focused towards a material gift or a spiritual blessing. Researchers at the University of Southern California developed a study involving inducing gratitude in participants while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and shed some light on the mysterious neurobiological correlates of gratitude.\nThe study selected first-person stories of survivors of the Holocaust drawn from a history archive and had professional actors breathe life into them by narration. The participants were immersed in the context of the Holocaust and vividly experienced the emotive scenarios themselves. Once they were engaged in the time period, they imagined receiving a series of gifts that were meant to elicit varying degrees of gratitude. After each gift, participants rated how much gratitude they felt. These ratings were associated with brain activity collected in the MRI.\nNeural Correlates of Gratitude, Fox et al, 2015\nGifts given varied from those that fulfilled a high amount of need but given with little effort. For example, during the early phase of the war, a local bakery leaves its unsold and old bread outside in the alley for you to eat. Other gifts came at a high degree of effort, but did not fulfill an important need. An example of this would be a gift in which a bed is offered to you in a concentration camp, but the bed is infested with rodents and insects. Finally, many of the gifts were given with high need and high effort, such as a fellow prisoner risking her life to steal food from the SS quarters and bring it to you while you are sick in the bunks. The varied examples allow for a precise examination of gratitude\u2019s bearing on the brain.\nSeveral regions involved in moral cognition showed high activity during the reflective, gratitude-inducing period. Specifically, activity in the medial pre-frontal cortex (MPFC) was associated with high ratings of gratitude. Studies have shown that reward from the relief of removing a stressor, self-processes and fairness in economic decisions all activate this brain region. Experiencing gratitude might divert the MPFC\u2019s general role of evaluating a situation to calculating the mental states of others.\nSimply, gratitude is an empathy amplification.\nMedial Prefrontal activity correlating with participants' gratitude ratings.\n\"Experiencing gratitude might divert the MPFC\u2019s general role of evaluating a situation to calculating the mental states of others. Simply, gratitude is an empathy amplification.\"\nGift-giving is social. It is related to understanding of others, and it stands to reason that the MPFC drives the thoughts behind the gifts which ultimately lead to gratitude. The overlap of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d regions in the MPFC suggest gratitude emerges from an understanding of other\u2019s minds in conjunction with our own needs. Indeed the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), one of the regions in theory of mind, elicited activity in the present study suggesting that gratitude is implicated in moral cognition.\nCrucially, feeling grateful is a powerful social emotion which lies at the intersection of the MPFC and the limbic system, a set of brain regions responsible for emotional processing. Researchers suggest the MPFC is a neural hub, connected to parasympathetic function and is critical for generating significance from an experience. In other words,\nWe derive meaning from thought flushed with powerful emotion.\nIn the context of the Holocaust, these results showcase that even a small gift of compassion, sacrifice and profound human dignity can strengthen social bonds.\nGratitude however, needs to be consciously learned, cultivated and applied. Below are some ideas that will help preserve the November attitude and turn it into lasting gratitude.",

    "context": "Paul Ryan: An Interesting Choice\nMy original column for this week started with, \u201cMy head is hurting.\u201d The subject, and what was causing the headache, was the lies, misleading sound bites and vituperative remarks that have, until now, characterized the current political campaign for president.\nOnce one starts down any path, whether it be accepting the sight of \u201crear-end\u201d cracks in public, public display of affection, rudeness as a virtue, or just plain meanness, it seems to grow like a snowball going downhill. It appears to me that this has happened in terms of the ugliness and irrelevance of political campaigning.\nOne might as well watch \u201cReal New Jersey Housewives\u201d to find out the state of the issues facing this country as to watch political ads.\nNot only that, but, once an ad has been \u201couted\u201d by fact checkers as false, it continues to run. Think of the Bain Capital ads, for example. How the guy who saved Staples has ruined the lives of workers\u2026.\nPresidential candidate Mitt Romney may have just made an attempt to turn this around with the nomination of Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin for vice president. If he really means, as he says he does, to turn this race from manure slinging to issue discussion, we owe him a debt of gratitude.\nMr. Romney may have also done something else that\u2019s extraordinary. He may have paid the American people a huge compliment by respecting them enough to believe that they will be able to find the truth through the smokescreen that is covering this nation.\nMaybe he\u2019s just doing it because he doesn\u2019t think he can win the \u201cmanure\u201d war that is going on.\nMaybe he really wants to create a campaign of issues, and believes the American people are smart enough to understand the real ones.\nLooking through AOL\u2019s \u201cnews stories\u201d around midday Tuesday, there were two mentions of Paul Ryan. The first headline used the words, \u201cBad News.\u201d Under that headline was a meaningless report comparing the number of people who today think Mr. Ryan is an asset to the campaign with the number who felt that way about vice presidential candidates at this point in prior elections.\nThe second was a piece discussing Bristol Palin\u2019s view of Congressman Ryan. Bristol is going to be praying for Mr. Ryan and his family because they are in for the most difficult 90 days of their lives. Wonder what would make her think that.\nI guess these stories give you AOL\u2019s slant on Paul Ryan. Conveniently located on about the same page was an opportunity to wish President Barack Obama a happy birthday.\nOf course, there\u2019s been a lot of other talk since the Veep nomination, and more manure slinging. One of my personal favorites is the assertion that Congressman Ryan\u2019s budget would destroy Medicare, and turn it into a voucher system, throwing grandma out of her wheelchair, so to speak.\nMr. Ryan says that his proposal was intended to save Medicare, by changing the present system for future retirees now under the age of 55, in order to insure that there are enough funds to provide the medical care already promised to seniors beyond that age. He said it would be completely unfair to deny them the benefits promised to them, since they planned their retirements around them.\nMr. Ryan is said to be very intelligent and a good guy. He is called by Paul Gigot, Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page editor, a member of the Reform Wing of the Republican Party. Mr. Gigot stated on Monday\u2019s \u201cOpinion Journal\u201d that Paul Ryan has helped to clarify Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in a more positive light for many voters, and that he has influenced former Massachusetts Governor Romney behind the scenes to clarify his positions on Medicare and tax reform.\nOther opinions include that Mr. Ryan is a Tea Party ideologue, a perfect leader for the racist, homophobic, extreme right wingers who want to hurt the poor in this country.\nPaul Ryan has a public reputation as a conservative. Among thinking people, he is considered intelligent, serious, thoughtful and charismatic, an experienced, effective congressman. If nothing else, he was willing to take the political risk of making a counter proposal to the president\u2019s budget, one that aimed to move in the direction of lowering debt, and moving in the direction of balance.\nStill, he could be either a risky choice politically for Governor Romney, or one that offers us hope, whatever the outcome, of an issues-based campaign. Nothing could be more needed at such a crucial time.\nDo we have the guts to vote for two white guys?",

    "context": "And, of course, through intense loyalty on the job, to each other and to their principles. And that explains why those who discover the McClure series are likely to become passionate followers, disappointed when they've consumed all eight books. (McClure died in 2006. He'd been a photographer, then a teacher, then a crime reporter.) The books won the Crime Writers Association (CWA) Silver Dagger and Gold Dagger awards. Soho Crime has been quietly bringing them to the US, and THE SUNDAY HANGMAN debuts in paperback in February.\nThe book opens with the unexpected death of a lifelong criminal named Tollie Erasmus. When Lieutenant Kramer hears that Erasmus committed suicide, he's frankly incredulous. Why would Tollie Erasmus hang himself, when he's got thousands to live on and has eluded South Africa's penal system? Because of the powerful class divisions in South Africa, and the multiple languages that go with them -- Afrikaans and English on one side, Bantu and other \"native\" languages on the other -- Kramer takes Mickey Zondi with him to investigate the rural death. And with Doc Strydom riding along, it's soon clear that the death is murder, not suicide.\nBut Doc Strydom pulls more out of police and court records, in a search to justify his outspoken decision on the death, and soon Kramer and Zondi are making multiple trips among Johannesburg, Durban, and the little rural hamlet of Witklip, trying to find points in common between this fresh death and other disturbing notes in the files.\nThis is a lively and compelling read, as well as a reminder of how desperate the apartheid situation was, so recently. The blatant and crushing racism of that time shows up in even the smallest casual conversations in THE SUNDAY HANGMAN, although McClure weaves it deftly into the narrative within a paternalism that feels a lot like a Kipling story. But the dangers of the racial prejudices show up in crimes and their investigation, and McClure spins a good tale.\nHere's the entire series with its original release dates:\nThe Steam Pig (1971)For a good overview of the past fifty years of mysteries set in Africa (and published in English), try this article from Verna Suit at Mystery Readers International (2010).\nThe Caterpillar Cop (1972)\nThe Gooseberry Fool (1974)\nSnake (1975)\nRogue Eagle (1976)\nThe Sunday Hangman (1977)\nThe Blood of an Englishman (1980)\nThe Song Dog (1991)\nFrom the review article, I was reminded that Henning Mankell's book The White Lioness (1993) is set in South Africa, as is Suzanne Arruda's Jade del Cameron series. I'm also a fan of a modern-day South Africa series by Jassy Mackenzie: Random Violence (2010), Stolen Lives (2011), and due out in April of this year, The Fallen (watch for more on that title later).\nIf you've been reading the Botswana series by Alexander McCall Smith, featuring the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, you'll find the McClure series more gritty and challenging. But underneath the two series is the same love of place, people, and the possibility of justice.",

    "context": "Sunday, October 17, 2010\nWeekend Wrap-up!\nWe had a fabulous fall weekend! Yesterday, we woke up bright and early to visit the pumpkin patch at Gentry Farms. It opened at 9 right when we got there. There were less than 20 cars in the parking lot and Evie had the run of the place. It was so nice! Evie loved it. We took a hayride, went through a few mazes, played in corn, rode little tractors, and slid down a few slides. Evie's favorite part was sititing in the little house at the table with her \"bowl.\" She loves little chairs so much and finds them everywhere she goes. We came home and put our pumpkins on the front step. Evie and Carl played outside for a bit. Nap time lasted four hours since our little pumpkin was worn out from her busy morning at the farm.\nI took a little nap too and then headed out for a bit to run a few errands and enjoy a little time to myself. My favorite thing was taking my Sonic strawberry lemonade in the library and reading all the fun magazines! It was so wonderful to have a chance to get away for a bit! Simple things like that mean so much more to me now than before Evie.\nEvie needed a Halloween costume so we took her to Halloween Express. Carl and I could not decide what to get her so we let her decide. She took every single ladybug costume off the rack so that was our clue that she wanted to be a ladybug. Our neighbors told us about a pizza place so we headed over there for some delicious pizza. We had planned to eat there but they only offered carry-out. It was so yummy and it was so funny seeing Evie devour that pizza. The owner had told us \"that children really respond well to his pizza\" and we think he was right! Evie pranced around the house in her new shoes and had some freshly baked warm chocolate chip cookies for dessert.\nEvie slept or at least stayed quiet in her crib until almost 8:30. It was so nice to sleep in without my little blond alarm clock going off before the sun was up. We took a long walk in the park and worked in the yard a little. Evie is such a good helper. She helped rake the pine straw and pick up the pine cones from our dead tree. Evie took a nap while we did a few things around the house. Carl helped me catch up on some chores which helps get my week off to a great start. I took a nap and read a little after our chores were finished. Have you read South of Broad by Pat Conroy? It's really interesting so far but I usually like any book that is set in Charleston. Our friend Christina gave us a buy one get one free coupon for a new yogurt shop so we took advantage of the gorgeous day and enjoyed some yummy yogurt with lots of fun toppings. Carl had 9 oz and I had 3 oz so they got a good deal on us but he shared with Evie. I think Evie got more yogurt on her new cupcake shirt then she did inside her mouth but she sure had fun.\nWe stopped to play at Owl Creek park on the way home. Evie was amazed to see a HUGE hot air balloon landing practically in our backyard. It was so cool and really brought the neighbors out to enjoy the beautiful day. Evie made friends with a lady and her hair clips.\nEvie was exhausted from her busy day and went to bed while we made some chicken fajitas for dinner. It's been a fun weekend! Hope you had a great weekend too.\nThank you for your comment!",

I would recommend the online company where I did mine, but she recently closed down\nIf you buy your own wood, make sure you give the measurements to the person cutting your vinyl so you can be sure your wording is the right size.\nSand down your board if necessary.\nPaint the board (make sure to paint the sides, but it\u2019s not necessary to do the back) as many coats as necessary. While the paint is drying, prep the vinyl. Do this by firmly rubbing a credit card or similar shape of plastic along the back of the vinyl, always in the same direction. This will help the vinyl separate from its paper all in one piece.\nOnce paint is dry, carefully adhere the vinyl to it. You can use the credit card to smooth out bubbles. Repeat with the 2nd phrase if applicable.\nGo outside and spray the board evenly with epoxy glue spray.\nOnce everything has dried and set, attach your hook to the back of the board. You\u2019re done!\nHelpful hint: When using two different lines of vinyl, I highly recommend using the darker color as the bottom line of text.\nSeptember 21, 2010 at 8:20 pm\nYou know, I remember Jenn at Baby Makin{g} Machine doing a vinyl board-type thing for Lil\u2019 J\u2019s nursery.

    "context": "\nStellar Interface is an Indie game that I have had the pleasure of playing through Steam on the PC. Each time you play the game you are placed into different runs through the game and once you are killed the run ends. Each stage within a run puts your ship back to full health so that you are able to go into the next level refreshed. Each stage gives the player three different possibilities of what the level could involve, broken down by a percentage, the closer a percentage is to 100 the more likely the level will involve one. The fourth variable that is presented is the level of difficulty which is rated from 1 to 5, 5 being the most difficult. Each run is different as the levels are procedurally generated so that the experience of a run is always different.\nThe game uses simple controls which don\u2019t take up any real concentration, which is very helpful when you work up to threat levels 3+, as the difficulty for each level does increase quite dramatically. The arrow keys move the ship, x is fire, c is dash, z lets you cycle between available consumables and space activates the chosen consumable. My only irritation with the controls is you can use any combination of movement, such as right and down to move in a diagonal line, apart from backwards. Which when you are in an awkward situation with all sorts of enemies, would have been quite useful. Before you begin a run, the player can choose between ships that they have unlocked, some will tell you what is most effective weaponry to be used as you can choose from a number of different weapons that you would like to begin with. The ship is limited by something called RAM which indicates the amount of energy available to run the guns. If they become higher RAM than the ship provides then this mix cannot be used together. The consumables are greatly helpful in a tight spot however, they tend to effect a large area on the battlefield which can be lifesaving on a number of occasions.\nAfter completing a stage the game presents the player with a chance to experiment with different power ups made available. Three will appear and each will tell you what it does, with the odd one not really specifying anything in particular which encourages you to just give it a shot and see what happens. These stack each level and help to make you a greater force to be reckoned with. These are different each run and can have a few different variations, with some even repeating so they can be made twice as effective. There are then different outcomes on each stage depending on the probability shown. If it is to be a normal stage then you are presented with a battlefield where an objective can be asked of you, or you just survive until the round finished, taking down as many enemies as you can. A merchant level presents the player chance to swap the gear on the ship, even unlocking new weapons which can then be used at the start of the game. A factory is the chance to be able to unlock a new ship, by completing the required mission for the level, the ship becomes available from the next run. A lost lord is a boss level, these tend to be difficult and present the player with a real test of skill. Probably one of the most important factors is the three missions that are visible throughout a run. These change each time and are to be achieved before you fail a stage. For each completed you unlock a cartridge which has a power up associated with it, when starting the next run you can pick from the unlocked and start with this power up on your ship. So the more you unlock the better the head start you can get.\nThis game has gone down the route of pixel art, which was not a bad choice, it gives the ships a bit of a retro feel which could gain the favour of players that enjoy this type of style but are usually a bit cautious around the permadeath game mechanic. I would have liked to see more variations of level settings as there are very few, I think this would have made runs more interesting and captured my interest as I enjoy the feel of not only the enemies changing but my surroundings. The variations of enemies is not bad, but I also feel like that would be something I would also like to see more of, however these can all be brought in with future game updates which would be great for the game when moving forward.\nThe music for this game is quite a generic techno soundtrack. It is simple but flows well with a constant rhythm which can help find your footing in some difficult stages. The sound effects are quite basic but are complimented slightly with the background music and graphics so they don\u2019t tend to take away from the impact of the game.\nThe game does have a high level of replayability for a couple of different reasons. As I have already mentioned, a run is procedurally generated so every time a play through is started it has a different combination of enemies, objectives, missions and patterns. As a choice of one out of three upgrades is available at the end of each completed stage, it is possible to have different builds each play through so that different combinations can be tested to get a more functional ship. The game being a permadeath situation also means a run is short so a player isn\u2019t sent back hours of gameplay time, reducing the frustration and making it easier to return time and time again\nI enjoyed this game quite a lot. The leaps in difficulty kept me on my toes and the permadeath was not an issue as it meant I could attempt different builds and try my luck with new combinations. I feel the enemies and players ship are quite large, it would have been nice for these to be shrank down a little to get a feel of having more space to work with and the screen not feeling so crowded. The introduction to being able to move backwards in a diagonal line would be great too, as it is only a little control, it can have a great impact as even though I knew it wasn\u2019t an available function, I still kept trying my luck. With these things in mind I will still return to this game frequently as it has the ease of being able to spend however much free time you have available. Whether this be half hour or a couple of hours, it is easy for time to go by as you try to push yourself further and further in search for defeating all of the lost lords and collecting all power ups possible..",

My motto is: Say no to the snowy mood! Let\u2019s make this winter colourful!\nVintage Hat\nThe hat I am wearing is a vintage fur hat made in Germany. My guess is that it was made in 80s.

Additionally, Balmain never fails to provide a strong structure to their clothing, bringing fortitude and power.

As a result, funding for critically needed public services has suffered in many areas, including:\n- K-12 education \u2013 where we remain last in the nation in per-pupil funding\n- Pre-K \u2013 where Utah remains behind the nation in the percentage of at-risk children who have access to high-quality Pre-K.\n- Higher education \u2013 where tuition continues to climb much faster than wages.\n- Drug treatment and mental health \u2013 where underinvestment threatens to undermine criminal justice reform.\n- Affordable housing \u2013 where state funding has not kept up with the effects of inflation, while rents rise faster than wages.\n- Homelessness \u2013 though we are encouraged to see the emerging consensus on the urgency of action.\n- Disability services \u2013 where starting wages for disabilities service workers remain below levels needed to reduce high turnover.\n- Health care \u2013 where Utah children are uninsured at a higher rate than nationally and Hispanic children at a higher rate than any other state.\nLow-Income Populations Should Be Held Harmless by Tax Reform\nNo one should be taxed into or deeper into poverty. So many of the individuals and families that we work with already struggle to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. They already pay sales, payroll, and property taxes (either directly or indirectly through their rent), and many pay income taxes as well. To ask them to pay more, especially at a time of growing inequality and a minimum wage that loses value every year, is unfair and unjustifiable.\nWe urge the Legislature to consider the financial barriers faced by Utah\u2019s most vulnerable populations as you grapple with the difficult challenge of reforming Utah\u2019s tax structure.\nPrinter-friendly Version:\nOpen Letter to the Utah Legislature: Tax Reform and Utah's Most Vulnerable Populations\nImage Credit: Amanda Mills, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our \"Making a Difference All Year Long\" sponsor.\n",

    "context": "Making the Connection: Cordless Phones Get Smart\nManufacturers are working to integrate cordless phones better with your smartphone and household appliances. That means that the price on basic cordless phones continues to drop, but the few competitors that remain in the market keep the connected models pricey.\nMasterfile\nSmartphones are ubiquitous, and landlines face talk of extinction, so you could be forgiven for thinking that the days of the cordless phone might be numbered. However, manufacturers of cordless phones aren\u2019t calling it quits and are shifting focus to other areas of the consumer-electronics market.\n\u201cSmartphones are great,\u201d says Brad Pittmon of VTech, which also makes AT&T-branded phones, \u201cbut they don\u2019t do one thing perfectly.\u201d\nSix experts with whom we spoke agree that the thing that cordless phones do perfectly\u2014or at least better than cellphones do\u2014is provide better call quality.\nNevertheless, manufacturers want to tie the cordless phone better to other means of communication that are in the household, particularly your smartphone. Beyond USB charging stations that can be found on the base unit of the latest cordless phones, manufacturers now enable connectivity that goes beyond simply letting you receive smartphone calls on your cordless phone. You now can be alerted to incoming text messages via your cordless phone, block calls to your smartphone (and cordless phone) and even run Google Android to surf the Internet.\nDespite these advancements, Nadra Maxwell of RCA says the shelf space for cordless phones at retailers is dwindling. The good news is that you can buy a basic cordless phone that delivers interference-free Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications, or DECT, technology and a range of up to 500 feet for as little as $14.95. (Three years ago, you had to pay at least $19.99 for an entry-level cordless phone that had a comparable range.) Cordless phones that provide connectivity to other devices, however, cost $100 more than do basic models, and manufacturers tell us that connected models will remain high-priced.\nSOLDIER ON. According to market-research company The NPD Group, sales of cordless phones slipped to 11.4 million in 2013, which represents an 18 percent decrease from 2011. Following that trend, Pittmon tells Consumers Digest that VTech\u2019s sales dropped by 17 percent since 2011. Although they didn\u2019t provide numbers, Panasonic and RCA also say their sales dropped during that time. (Uniden, which is the other main provider of cordless phones, didn\u2019t respond to repeated calls.)\nAccording to a Federal Communications Commission report from June 2013, 102 million landlines operated in the United States as of 2012, but that number is down 28 percent from 2008.\nThe movement away from landlines to cellphones appears to be a factor in AT&T\u2019s July 2013 announcement that it would end landline service by 2020.\nAT&T didn\u2019t respond to our requests for comment, but John Bergmayer of Public Knowledge, which is a consumer advocacy group for the technology market, says consumers shouldn\u2019t worry. Other landline options should be available even with AT&T out of the market, he tells Consumers Digest. Bergmayer says that in the next few years, companies also increasingly will provide other types of phone service for homes, such as fiber-optic or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\nRoss Rubin, who is a telecommunications analyst at consultancy Reticle Research, says that even if your cordless phone doesn\u2019t have a built-in plug for VoIP connections, most service providers can supply an adapter. Also, if your service provider takes away your landline, you still can use a cordless phone through VoIP as long as you have Internet service. Should your Internet connection fail, that likely means that phone service also will be lost, but Rubin says \u201cmillions of consumers\u201d find VoIP to be an acceptable alternative to landlines.\nAccording to Chris Miller of IdoNotes, which is an independent online reviewer of electronics, the trade-off of switching to VoIP service from a landline now is performance. He says VoIP eats up a lot of bandwidth, so you might be subject to choppy or dropped calls. However, both Miller and Rubin say they expect bandwidth to improve in the next few years.\nStay Connected",

    "context": "- ABOUT\n- RESEARCH\n- EXPERTS\n- DONATE\nSearch\nChart Book: The Legacy of the Great Recession\nUPDATED\nJanuary 9, 2018.2 percent annual growth since then.\nEmployers Added 188 17.8 million jobs to their payrolls for 94 consecutive months from March 2010 through December 2017, an average of 189,000 jobs a month. Total employment (private plus government) averaged 188,000 a month over that period, as federal, state, and local government were net job losers.\nTotal nonfarm employment rose by 148,000 jobs in December, private employment rose by 146,000 in December, federal government employment rose by 1,000, state employment fell by 4,000, and local employment rose by 5,000.\nPart II: The Recession Put the Economy in a Deep Hole\nGDP Fell Far Below What the Economy Was Capable of Producing\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the demand for goods and services (actual GDP) was roughly $44 billion (about 0.2 percent) greater than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)\u2019s estimate of what the economy was capable of supplying (potential GDP). This suggests that the output gap between actual and potential GDP, which was manifested in excess unemployment and underemployment and idle productive capacity among businesses, has essentially closed. However, CBO\u2019s estimate predated the annual updating of GDP data that took place in July. GDP data for the previous three years were updated to incorporate more complete and more detailed source data as well as methodological improvements that raised the level of GDP by about $50 billion going into the second quarter of this year. CBO\u2019s estimates of potential GDP do not currently reflect these changes and could change modestly once they are taken into account.\nGDP rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2017 and was 2.3 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago. The latter figure slightly exceeds the 2.2 percent average annual growth since the start of the recovery.\nIn its June 2017 Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook, issued before the July GDP revisions, CBO projected that the gap between actual and potential GDP would close in 2018. CBO does not try to forecast business-cycle fluctuations, but instead assumes that real GDP growth will reflect underlying trends in the economy\u2019s capacity to produce goods and services and that after 2020, actual GDP will be 0.5 percentage points lower than potential GDP, which is roughly the average historical gap.\nJob Losses Were Unprecedented 6.5 percent (9.0 million) higher in December 2017 than it was at the start of the recession.\nSurpassing the pre-recession peak was a milestone on the way to a full jobs recovery, but population growth over the past several years means the potential labor force is larger than it was then. Job creation has averaged 171,000 a month over the past 12 months and 204,000 over the past three months. This pace is well. The unemployment rate has been under 4.5 percent for the last 9 months and has been 4.1 percent for the last three. The unemployment rate is much lower now than it was early in the recovery, but there still may be people who are not working but want to be or people who would like to be working full time but can only find part-time jobs who can be pulled back into the labor market if job creation remains. The labor force participation rate averaged 62.8 percent in 2017 and was 62.7 percent in December; the employment-to-population ratio averaged 60.1 percent in 2017 and was also 60.1 percent in December.\nThe employment-to-population ratio shown in the chart is for those aged 16 and older and includes an increasing number of retired baby boomers. Thus, a significant percentage of the decline since the start of the recession reflects demographic trends rather than labor market weakness. While this rate remains 2.6 percentage points lower than it was at the start of the recession, the employment-to-population ratio for those in their prime working years (age 25-54), which fell 4.9 percentage points between the start of the recession and December 2009, has recovered all but 0.6 percentage points of that loss and was 79.1 percent in December. of 2015. That rate has edged down over the past year and was 0.9 percent in December. Still, over a fifth (22.9 percent) of the 6.6 million people who were unemployed \u2014 1.5. After falling to 8.0 percent in October \u2014 the lowest it\u2019s been since early 2007 \u2014 this rate edged up to 8.1 percent in December. That\u2019s still lower than it was in the year before the Great Recession, but more than a percentage point higher than it was in 2000.\nGrowth in Workers Earnings Has Been Modest\nAverage hourly earnings of employees on private payrolls grew modestly through much of the recovery, and to date have averaged 2.2 percent annually. Inflation has been modest as well, but over much of the economic recovery, real (inflation-adjusted) wages hardly grew and have failed to keep up with increases in workers' productivity (output produced per hour of work).\nAs a result, the share of national income going to profits rose relative to that going to wages. Both inflation and productivity have fluctuated more than nominal earnings during this period, but, on average, productivity has risen at roughly 1 percent per year from the end of the recession through the third quarter of 2017 and the cost of a typical worker\u2019s market basket has risen about 1\u00be percent per year over the same period.\nThe pace of wage growth quickened in 2015 and into 2016, but has subsequently slowed. In December 2017, average hourly earnings of all employees on private payrolls were 2.5 percent higher than a year earlier (earnings of non-management employees were up 2.3 percent). Low inflation in 2015 and 2016 led to solid real wage gains, but strong nominal wage growth will be required to maintain such gains if inflation rises further.\nThe Number of People Looking for Work Swelled Compared with the Number of Job Openings\nAt one point at the beginning of the recovery there were 7 people looking for work for every job opening. That ratio has declined substantially and is now near its historic low just before the 2001 recession in data that go back to December 2000. In November 2017, 6.6 million workers were unemployed, compared with 5.9 million job openings (a ratio of 11 job seekers for every 10.",

But, the season is upon us so I thought an update was in order.\nThis year, I\u2019ve paid my membership dues to our clubs and schools, and sent a bit of extra money their way to account for the fundraising I don\u2019t plan to participate in. At present, we\u2019re in fundraising season for 5th grade graduation, plus they requested a contribution check. This is our first graduation season and thus far fundraising seems to consist of selling candy, baked goods, drinks, etc. at other school events. I sent my contribution check, but the events aren\u2019t things I plan to go to.\nToday the elementary school had a fundraiser with the local farm stand. This I do participate in. The difficulty is that at this point of the winter they don\u2019t have much local produce so its more like a boutique grocery store. So, I bought apple cider, deli chicken, and flowers. Unfortunately, our preschool has its fundraiser at the same farm stand next week so I may have more cider and flowers to enjoy. I might indulge in some fancy cheese. It would have been great if they\u2019d been spaced out a bit, but few people are associated with both so the schedules aren\u2019t coordinated.\n",

The completely virtual event is produced annually by the Real Estate CyberSpace Society, a professional real estate organization with over 9,000 members and 120 Chapters worldwide.\nAfter the 7-day event adjourned, the Convention staff released statistics reflecting a significant degree of satisfaction on the part of attendees, sponsors and exhibitors.\nAccording to Convention Director, Angela Portosa, the post convention attendee survey revealed that agents rated the event with an overwhelming 97.6% overall satisfaction rating.

For the videos Google is providing 1 GB storage with a maximum resolution of 1920x1080.\nAdditional storage capacity can be bought,\u201d said the blog post.\nWhat would be the added advantage in uploading videos in Google docs when YouTube has more features and a bigger file size limit than Google Docs? \u201campercent \u201c a tech web site says there might be many situations when you may want your Videos uploaded through Google Docs rather than through YouTube.\nFor a bunch of documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, photos and videos stored in hard drive, one would always require quick back up for all these files at one place without uploading them to separate online storage spaces like Windows Live Skydrive, Flickr.\nThe site said even Dropbox is good for backups but one does not have a Dropbox account yet and is unaware of how it works.\nMoreover, when users would not want personal videos to be public and need a safe place to upload videos privately Google Doc would give more comfortable sharing setting.\nAt present Tens of millions people have moved to Google Docs for its 100 percent web, said another Google blog post.\nAccording to the post, the search engine is fully aware that users still use Microsoft Office, because until recently, there weren\u2019t many tools to help them collaborate and share with others.\n,\u201d said Shan Sinha, Group Product Manager, and Google.\nThose who are still not able to move to Google Docs from Microsoft Office, for them Google earlier offered many good things.\nUsers of Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 can sync their office documents to the Google cloud, without ever leaving office, said the post earlier.\nAlso, once synced, documents are backed-up, given a unique URL, and can be accessed from anywhere (including mobile devices) at any time through Google Docs. Since the files are store\u2019re bringing them to Microsoft Office,\u201d said the post.\nHowever, with the new release this year Google has ensured that users with shared folders can store, organize, and collaborate on files more easily using Google Docs. For example, if one is in a club or PTA working on large graphics files for posters or a newsletter, one can upload them to a shared folder for collaborators to view, download, and print.\nAlso, users can search for document files uploaded by them and will be able to view many common document file types with the Google Docs viewer.",

    "context": "This next part of Carpenter\u2019s story brings up an important issue. Indenture amounted to legal slavery, but it appears that even some Natives pursued this option over being imprisoned on a reservation. Reservations were notoriously dangerous places, where Natives were dependent on incompetent and downright abusive Indian agents for food, shelter and protection. Ironically, they also became collecting spots for Indian traders. The concentration of Natives on a reservation made it easier for men to gather children and young squaws without the trouble of hunting them down. Natives who attempted to leave the \u201cprotection\u201d of the reservation were sometimes shot, even if they were starving and in search of food.\nI believe there were quite a few settlers that offered asylum to the Natives through indenture. It was a scary time to be Indian, and for some, falling under white protection, even if as a slave, may have been their only hope.\nContinued from 8/31/09 post\n\u2026 About this time the Department of Indian Affairs ordered all Indians living in their tribal relations to the reservation. Many of them had been there, and not liking the treatment they received, preferred rations of acorns a part of the time and starvation afterwards to going under Uncle Sam\u2019s protection.\nAn attempt was made to force them to the reservation, but they fled to the hills and did not return until the officers were at a safe distance. The local story runs that then a learned judge of Cal- pella in his blandest tones tried persuasion. \u201d Now, boys,\u201d he said, addressing them, \u201d I have been here among you a long time, and you all know I am ami- cus humani generis, or I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you today; and I am thoroughly convinced that it would be to the interest of every one of you to go sine. mom. Of course you would be kept sumptibus publicis, and if everything didn\u2019t go adgustus, it certainly is the great desideratum. We do not intend to force you to go nolens volens, but as I have tried to make you understand, it most assuredly is commune boiium.\u201d\nO, why did n\u2019t he say \u201d nix cum rouse,\u201d and give them a certain time in which to guess the puzzle ! [Lynette\u2019s note\u2026 this is completely lost on me\u2026 anyone that can explain this is encouraged to try]\nBefore the second appearance of the officers, determined to enforce the governmental order, many of the Indians took advantage of the State law, and obtained guardians,\u2014 whole families being bound to one person. The rest again sought shelter in the mountains. Conspicuous among the latter were Captain John and family.\nIn Little Lake Valley some persons were bitterly opposed to Indians, and aided the officers in getting them to the reservation. A little later some of the exiles returned to their homes and were shot down like wild animals. Two old blind squaws escaped in the brush and were soon several miles from their murdered companions; but it was not long before hunger overcame their discretion, and their piteous howls attracted the attention of some hunters, who kindly took them to a neighboring valley. From that day to this, Little Lake Valley has had no resident Indians.\nThe Indians were quiet and well-behaved, and made their guardians no trouble ; but to the shame of some of the guardians, the same cannot be said of them. In many cases a great mistake was made as to the party that needed restraint. A few of the Indians were allowed to remain in the rancheria, were paid for all labor as before, and kindly treated, but the majority were forced to come and live on the ranch and work without remuneration. Some complained that they did not even have enough to eat. Some guardians were so exacting that if an Indian was wanted for work he must come, unless his excuse was as good as that once given for a witness who did not appear in court. There were nine reasons why the witness was absent. \u201d State them,\u201d said the Judge. \u201d In the first place he is dead.\u201d Just so with the Indian who would remain at home in harvest time; to do so with impunity he must be dead. Once an Indian who refused to work had his hands tied behind him with one end of a lariat, the other being securely fastened to the horn of the rancher\u2019s saddle; thus the trio started for the harvest field. The horse bucked his rider off, and dragged the Indian some distance. When he was picked up, both arms were dislocated at the shoulder, having been turned from back to front. This of course was an extreme case, and did not meet with general approval. A more common method of correction, as an Indian expressed it, was to be \u201d whipped with a picket fence.\u201d\nMany times, under the cover of night, the rancheria has been surrounded by human monsters, armed with knives and pistols. The poor creatures, afraid of their very lives, have many, many times left their beds and fled for protection to a neighboring farmhouse. If an Indian dared attempt a defense of his wife or sister, he was fortunate indeed if he escaped a shot or stab, in connection with a sound beating.\nThe kind farmer who gave the Indians permission to come and sleep in his barn at such times was a good Samaritan on many occasions, and is still able to laugh over his great surgical feat of putting in place Sam\u2019s protruding liver, and stitching a knife wound of several inches in length, which was inflicted by a boy still in his teens.\nOnce, a boy on his way home from school threw a stone at some majellas. and killed a baby that hung in a basket on the mother\u2019s back. It was the expressed opinion that he was a bad boy. but no complaint was made ; probably his parents never even heard of the circumstance.\nTo be continued \u2026\nMore happy stuff, I know, but I think the perspective of a first hand witness is invaluable to the study of this time period.\nsigh\nThere isn\u2019t much to say to this, is there?\nno, there isn\u2019t. Where do we find a way to see our own horrors as clearly as we can see those of the past? Reading this it seems so obvious that the \u201cgood\u201d people should have fought to protect the Indians. What will our descendants think we should have seen?\nOh geez\u2026 that is such a frightening thought.\nThough I think if we are objective\u2026 there are so many human rights violations and cruelties happening every day (I don\u2019t know if you saw my post about what is happening in the Congo\nBut I think we do know what is wrong, and what we tolerate anyway\u2026 this is such a big topic\u2026\nIt brings up the question of what we should do, and what we can do, realistically\u2026\nWhich is probably EXACTLY the questions folks here faced back then",

I\u2019ll also have a \u2018Beauty: Past, Present, & Future\u2019 series which will focus on skin care, and \u2018Hair Care: Past, Present, & Future\u2019 that will review favorite hair products to keep your hair looking fabulous!\nWithout further ado, this week\u2019s category will be \u2018Everything Eyeshadow\u2019.\nPAST\n- Rimmel: Glam Eyes Trio (I used this mini set of eyeshadows forever ago when I was in high school. I can\u2019t remember the exact product name of shades, but it was composed of mostly neutrals and browns.)\n- Revlon: Illuminance Cream Shadow (Not Just Nudes)\n- Very creamy\n- Thick consistency\n- Light pigmentation\n- Maybelline: Eye Studio Color Plush Silk Eyeshadow Quad (Purple Icon)\n- My favorite drugstore eyeshadow!\n- Silky smooth consistency.\n- Highly pigmented.\n- Lasts for hours without a primer\n- Blends beautifully.\n- Maybelline Color Tattoo: (Electric Blue) & (Inked in Pink)\n- A lot of people rave about the shade \u2018Bad to the Bronze\u2019. Personally, I haven\u2019t tried that one, but the other two colors that I did try felt too thick in consistency for me and the product dried up too quickly.\n- Bottom line: I personally wouldn\u2019t repurchase.\n- Urban Decay: Ammo Shadow Box Eyeshadow Palette\n- My first Urban Decay eyeshadow palette.\n- Fell in love with the shades: Last Call, Maui Wowie, Mildew, and Smog.\n- Highly pigmented\n- Lots of metallics\n- Urban Decay: Naked Eyeshadow Palette\n- Years ago, I couldn\u2019t decide between the original \u2018Naked\u2019 palette and \u2018Naked 3\u2019, but after asking an Ulta associate what her recommendation would be, I ultimately chose the original.\n- I loved the shades: Virgin, Sin, Naked, Sidecar, Buck, Smog, Darkhorse, and Toasted, but found myself not using much of Half Baked, or Creep. I only used Creep for defining the outer corner of my eye.\n- The pigmentation was amazing, but was it worth the $54.00? It depends. While it\u2019s a great eyeshadow palette for neutrals, nowadays, there are a lot of other neutral palettes that are duplicates for the entire Urban Decay: Naked eyeshadow palette line. Makeup Revolution: Iconic Redemption palettes in 1, 2, and 3 are very similar copies and are only $7.00 each.\n- However, the Makeup Revolution mattes in their Iconic 3 Redemption palette were not as buttery as Urban Decay.\n- Urban Decay: Shadow Box Eyeshadow Palette\n- At the time that I bought it, I believe it was about $34.00, or $36.00 at Ulta. I thought it was a good price for Urban Decay shadows, so I picked it up because of that, and because it had a few jewel toned eyeshadows.\n- In the end, I barely used the palette because the colors were not as pigmented, or flattering as I thought they would be for shades such as Flash and Freelove, and Bordello on my skin tone.\n- I ended up passing the palette on to a family member.\n- Makeup Revolution: Iconic 3 Redemption Eyeshadow Palette\n- The metallics were very pigmented and beautiful. They mimic the quality of a lot of high end eyeshadows. So many compliments from strangers when creating eyeshadow looks with these!\n- The matte shades were slightly patchy, and not as buttery as Urban Decay, but still had a light to medium pigmentation when built up.\nPRESENT\n- Bronx Eyeshadow Palette (customized with baked single eyeshadows)\n- Too Faced: White Chocolate Chip Palette\n- Tarte: Tartelette Tease\n- By far my favorite neutrals palette. I\u2019ve found that even when I had my Urban Decay: Naked palette and Tartelette Tease palette at the same time last year, I chose Tarte more often.\n- Used all of the shade Whisper, which lasted 6 months.\n- Catrice: Velvet Matt Eyeshadow (040 Al Burgundi)\n- Extremely pigmented for a matte eyeshadow, even in comparison to BFF from the Tartelette Tease.\n- Great for a winged eyeshadow look.\n- Defining the outer corner of the eye.\n- Perfect for blending.\n- Urban Decay (Midnight Cowboy) deluxe birthday sample from Ulta\n- A perfectly pigmented glittery shadow that also works well topped over a blush on the eyes.\n- Has a tiny bit of fallout, but can be avoided with using a sponge applicator, fingers, or brushing off excess before applying foundation and concealer.\nFUTURE\n- KIKO MILANO: Water Eyeshadow (On my wishlist)\n- 209 Olive Green\n- 213 Dark Slate Green\n- 228 Taupe\n- Chantecaille: Protect the Wolves Eye Shade Trio (Wishlist)\n- Saw reviews on YouTube, and pictures on Google of the third shade in the palette called Evergreen which looks gorgeous!\n- Charlotte Tilbury: \u2018Luxury Palette\u2019 Colour-Coded Eyeshadow Palette (Wishlist)\n- The Glamour Muse (mostly purple eyeshadows)\n- The Rebel (green eyeshadows)\n- Makeup Revolution: Fortune Favors the Brave (Wishlist)\n- I\u2019ve been wanting to try this palette since last July, but am a bit hesitant due to some saying it does not have great pigmentation, and others saying that it performs better with an eyeshadow primer or wet brush.\n- I love the variety of eyeshadow colors from the pictures. It ranges from neutrals, olive greens, deep teals, pinks, and purples, and some blues. It\u2019s literally every shade that I could ever want in a palette. One day, I\u2019ll cave in and purchase it, I am sure.\nNot Your Cup of Fashion",

She was from Dhaka\u2026She was looking for her life partner. She sent us these photos from Bangladesh. How easy to get relationship with Bengali girls? I studied her portfolio, I got it\u2026. She was a lady doctor, Medical college and hospital trainee. She was looking for handsome but relevant to her medical field young boy. I though for doctors finding female doctors not so hard, Bengali female is waiting for young guys for friendship and then wants to have long life relationship.\nAbove photo is her photo in Dhaka Hospital, I think she forget to wrote her name in the email.\nI think I don\u2019t need to mention about loyalty of Bengali girls, Because every one known about Bangladeshi girls loyalty and their respect.

Some girls like to keep their hair really natural, thick and wild everywhere and some like modern hair. Many have big noses, which are a sign of sensual vitality. LOL Most of them look like Bollywood actresses. There is no need to go to Bollywood to find a model or star. Any village has potential brides that look better than most Bollywood stars, really. All these ladies look good if they find their unique style. I believe every girl is a beautiful princess in Pakistan; you just have to be poet enough to see her beauty. Every Desi or Urdu or Paki girl is a beautiful flower waiting for her bee to find her to transform her life into sweet honey.

Most Pakistani women are Muslim and are respectful to their family and their husbands. Society is hierarchical and traditional values rule, it is a patriarchal society. Multan, Faisalabad and Sahiwal are the small cities of the Pakistan where most of the girls are quite innocent and want to grow like big cities girls.0.Dhaka girls waiting for your call\nMobile..This Photo is one of the beautiful young and teen age girl from Chittagong, Bangladesh.

You've had less collective advocacy, less unified positions and less ability to get out and inform consumers about what is going on,\" Corbin said.\nSince the ATUG forum Corbin said the working group of various telecommunications consumer groups had been setup, and the principal agreement among them was that a new peak consumer body should be formed.\nCTN will co-ordinate the forming of the entity, using the $87,000 grant to develop a constitution, objectives and purposes for the new peak body, as well as building a brand, logo and Web site.\n\"CTN will act as the co-ordinating body to ensure the smooth transition to the new strengthened body,\" Senator Conroy said.\n\"There are many practical considerations to setting up a new body such as this. Some are particularly difficult for not-for-profit organisations such as those charged with this task.\"\nCorbin said at this stage CTN is looking at a number of telecommunications representation groups to form the new peak body. These include CTN, Tedicore - a telecommunications disability representation group, and the small business representation group SETEL.\n\"We're looking at those organisations to form the core of the new peak body,\" she said.\n\"We have to prepare a proposal for the Minister by the end of July, so that's what this funding is going towards. We have to get our consumer groups and all our constituencies to support that proposal so that it's not just something that is imposed from above but something that has really come from the community. So there's consultation in all directions.\"\nCorbin said CTN will discover whether Conroy supports the proposal over the next 6 weeks.\n\"After July we'll get some sort of idea form the Minister on whether he supports the proposal, then he'll take it forward to Cabinet, and then the hope is that we'll get some funding in the May federal budget. Then we'll actually form the new peak body before next year, but it won't be funded until 2009, that's the hope,\" she said",

Bruce Cameron wrote in \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose,\u201d which is coming to the big screen in January, 2017.\nWhile \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d is an adult novel, Cameron cleverly adapted parts of the book for children\u2019s stories, and \u201cBailey\u2019s Story\u201d is the natural sequel to \u201cEllie\u2019s Story,\u201d also from \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose.\u201d In Bailey\u2019s story, readers meet the puppy Bailey, who escapes from the breeder\u2019s property where he was born. This breeder, or perhaps a puppy mill, is a place where mothers languish in their cages living on concrete until their puppies are taken away. The human who feeds them doesn\u2019t talk to them, pet them, or give them any affection at all. While the grass is tantalizingly just outside their cages, the adult dogs almost never get to feel the grass under their feet.\nBailey escapes from this place as a young puppy and ends up almost dying shortly after that. He is rescued, and he joins Ethan\u2019s family. Ethan, being played as an adult by Dennis Quaid, is a young boy when Bailey joins their family. The children\u2019s book focuses on the relationship between Ethan and Bailey.\nThe story is told in first person, narrated by Bailey. Like any dog, while there are things that Bailey understands, there is much that he doesn\u2019t understand. What the reader understands is that Bailey loves Ethan with every molecule in his body. Ethan\u2019s parents are merely there as side characters \u2014 this is about a boy and his dog.\nApropos of a children\u2019s book and a children\u2019s ending to the book, Bailey does not die in this novel. While in \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose,\u201d Bailey dies and is reincarnated over and over, in each of the children\u2019s books, Cameron visits one of the dog\u2019s many lives and shares the particulars of that life with the young readers.\nEnjoy the book \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d before the movie, and share the fun by giving a child \u201cBailey\u2019s Story: A Dog\u2019s Purpose Novel\u201d before the movie comes out, too.\nPlease note: This review is based on the final, hardcover book provided by the publisher, Starscape, for review purposes.\nSounds wonderful\u2026.\ni\u2019m even tearing up at the trailers\u2026",

Today I'm sharing an idea I came up with while scrapping with the girls last weekend.\nEvery other month or so (though we'd like to be more frequent) the ladies in my family and a few friends get together to craft all day. Last Saturday, my Mom's friend joined us and challenged me to come up with an idea for an empty medication bottle she had. Well, actually - she claims that she has MANY of these bottles and just can't get rid of them because she knows that there must be something great to create with them.\nEver have that thought about something? It's so hard to part with little treasures that you just know someday will come in handy, isn't it?\nI stared at that bottle forever and just couldn't seem to come up with anything other than storage for small crafting supplies (buttons, brads, doo-dads, etc.). Finally, while going through my MCT stamps for inspiration, I found this adorable little tooth duo and knew just what to do with the bottle - a little capsule for the Tooth Fairy!\nNow, I realize that this isn't exactly an idea to mass produce with all of the bottles this friend has, but I was happy to come up with something! *giggle*\nThe project is pretty simple, but I think it's just darling. I added a little sparkle with some Star Dust Stickles and a little rhinestone. The teeth are very lightly colored in with gray Copics.\nMCT Products Used\nAll Around Everything Stamp Set\nAll Around Everything Accessories Stamp Set\nThanks for stopping by to see my project today! Be sure to check out Emma's blog to see what the other designers have in store for you!\nI hope you were inspired!\n- Veronica\nToo cute!!\nThat is really adorable! Love this idea, Veronica!!!\nThis is a great idea! How fun for a child to put their tooth in here! Great job decorating it too!\nExcellent use for this bottle Veronica! I'm sure your mom's friend was impressed! Have a wonderful day! Love and Hugs, Cathryn :)\nYOU ARE SOOOO GOOD my friend! I LOVE IT!\nHUGS!\nThese are super cute and would be a great idea for a grandparent to give to each of their grandkids, maybe with their names on the bottle too. I love this idea!\nHow cute and creative! I have that problem...I think they call it hoarding...lol! Too cute!!! :)\nThat is adorable and very clever. It will be a lot easier to find under a pillow ;) Maybe your friend has children with little ones who could use these...each kid has their own with their name? That should use up a few of these bottles. Wonderful job!\nquilt 4 fun 2 at hot mail dot com",

Join us.\nHere\u2019s why.\nHorse Meat Inspection Defunding\n(1) If the defunding provision of USDA horse meat inspections continues so it cannot be exported for sale, we still need to continue working hard to close the transport to slaughter loophole.\n(2) If the defunding provision of USDA horse meat inspections fails, we need to already be actively working at the State level to let lawmakers and elected official know its residents are strongly opposed to horse slaughter returning to U.S. soil in their State.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if horse slaughter is already banned in your State. There are movements afoot right now, specifically in Texas, to overturn the law against horse slaughter should the defunding language not make it into the Appropriations bill. Reports from feedlot operators in Texas tell us that they are scouting facilities for the re-opening of horse slaughter plants . . . plants, plural.\nThe Safe Act\nWe do not know if the federal bill banning horse slaughter \u2014 H.R. 113 \u2014 will be successful or not. It is in Committees and Subcommittees. That\u2019s a lot to fight its way out of.\nHowever, say that it is signed into law making the slaughter and transport of U.S. horses for slaughter illegal. There are enough paid traitors in Washington D.C. who will eagerly take blood money to overturn a ban on horse slaughter by sneaking language into an unsuspected piece of lengthy or obscure legislation.\nThere is no doubt about it. Pro horse slaughter forces are busy at work. We need to be busy at work against horse slaughter.\nHere\u2019s how you can help.\nTake a Stand\nPlease fill out the following form and go on record against horse slaughter so we can compile lists of residents against it to submit to State Governors, lawmakers and elected officials. Doing it here creates an electronic trail.\nYou must check the box if you are opposed to horse slaughter or we cannot use your submission.\nMake a Donation\nMake a donation to help with expenses. It is important that we have at least one lobbyist in every State responsible for leading our campaigns.\nLocal lobbyists are expert in area politics, the inner workings of their State legislatures (which vary widely across the country), who are \u201cboots on the ground\u201d able to provide us with information we can get no other way, even if we are physically there ourselves. Local lobbyists are always immensely helpful in identifying potential powerful allies (and enemies).\nPlease share this message across all media platforms to help us gather large numbers of residents of every State to make a strong, solid voice against horse slaughter. Thank you!\nDo More\nTweet State Governors. See this Twitter campaign from March Against Horse Slaughter \u00bb\n2 thoughts on \u201cJoin our State Anti-Horse Slaughter Campaign\u201d\nStatistics have shown there is NO HUMANE way to process or render a horse ! They awaken mid stream to UnGodly dismemberment & more ! The fact this meat is not fit for Human Consumption should be realized if not for Our Citizens but others in the World , many of whom haven\u2019t a bit of information on this and are feeding to pregnant women & children !!\nHorses go through terror and agony in the slaughtering process which\nis done by business minded owners who care only about profit and\nnothing about protecting the horses from terror, fear and agony.\nHorses are not supposed to be used for meat. They are\nhuman companions and helpers and their true physical beauty is a gift to the whole\nworld and we all should cherish that gift.\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

That isn't morally right or fiscally sound.\nInstead, let's try to get more value for our money, like by letting Medicare negotiate for better drug prices, and make sure-bet investments with huge economic payoffs, like investing in our kids' health and education.\nRepublicans in Congress are offering to help pass the GOP tax plan for the wealthy that America just rejected if we help them pass the GOP plan to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid that America still rejects.\nLIKE My Facebook Page\nFollow @EgbertoWillies\nATTACKS AND RESPONSES\nATTACK: \"The deficit is a huge threat to our country.\"\nRESPONSE:\n- Really? A bigger threat than terrorists or climate change or the mass unemployment crisis? How does the deficit affect you personally?\n- Of course Washington should be responsible with taxpayer money. The budget needs to be what's best for the country. The good news is that the best way to fix the deficit is to fix jobs first.\n- This deficit scare talk is coming from politicians who think Social Security and education funding are too popular. The actual economic experts are warning that if we let those politicians force European-style austerity on America, we're inviting another recession -- and even bigger deficits.\n- Let's also remember what's driving the deficit: the Great Recession, borrowed money for the two wars, and the Bush tax cuts -- which came from the same Republican politicians who are now trying to use the mess they created to push through their ideological agenda.\nATTACK: \"Entitlements are out of control and needs to be cut.\"\nRESPONSE:\n- Let's be clear what we're talking about: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Voters were clear about the mandate they handed down this election: don't mess with these programs.\n- In fact, in these times of tight budgets, we should be investing more in what works -- the most efficient systems for securing our health care and financial security.\n- But instead of trying to protect these programs and get more value for our dollars, Republicans in Congress are trying to use the deficit they created to scare us -- so we'll let them privatize Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher, and wash their hands of Medicaid altogether.\n- And to fix the deficit, let's go with the most fiscally responsible way we know how -- fix jobs first.\nATTACK: \"Liberals never want to cut any spending at all, including waste.\"\nRESPONSE:\n- Actually, where there's waste -- like Big Oil subsidies, special tax breaks for the wealthy, and outdated Pentagon pork our military leaders don't want -- we should cut it.\n- We should also be trying to get more value for our money, like by letting Medicare negotiate for better drug prices and stopping wasteful overpayments to private insurance companies.\n- So instead of more tax cuts for the wealthy, we want to make sure-bet investments with huge economic payoffs for everyone, like investing in jobs and in our kids' health and education.\n- Which approach to the budget sounds more fiscally responsible to you? The problem is that Republicans and their corporate allies oppose getting rid of the actual waste -- while pushing for more tax cuts for themselves.\nATTACK: \"Americans are living longer so the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare should go up.\"\nRESPONSE:\n- It's great news that people are living longer, though it's not true for everybody. Let's make sure we all have decent retirement income and health coverage when we actually starting needing it, not at some age made up by politicians in Washington toying around with budget numbers.\n- These are the kinds of arguments you often hear from wealthy corporate CEOs and out-of-touch politicians who really just don't like Social Security and Medicare -- and never had to do hard manual labor or worry about their own health insurance.\n- How sensible does it sound to you to force people to get less from our most efficient and popular systems like Medicare, so they either have to go without or pay more for less from private insurers? If we want to save money, let's start by letting Medicare negotiate for better drug prices.\n- And to keep our Social Security system strong, there's an easy adjustment: instead of letting millionaires and billionaires pay a lower rate, close the tax loophole that lets them pay a lower rate than the rest of us for the same guarantee.",

    "context": "People love children, right? And they also love animals. So animals that live in your house while you take care of them as if they were your own offspring? What\u2019s not to love!\nOf course, talking, child-like critters that occasionally dabble with world-altering forces might be a bit much for even the most steadfast animal lover.\nHousepets, by Rick Griffin.\nCreated in 2008, Housepets follows the antics of a neighborhood full of pets in a world where animals are essentially just like hairy children raised by their human owners. They play games with their friends, they have clubs, they watch tv and movies, imagine their own stories, hate going to the vet and taking baths, and occasionally commune with the deities of ancient forgotten temples\u2026 alright, so maybe not exactly like children.\nCharacters\nToo many to get into all at once, but in a nutshell we have;\nPeanut, a lovable, hyperactive pup. He\u2019s usually the Funny Man to Grape\u2019s Straight and his naive innocence plays off of Grape\u2019s sarcastic maturity. Although he\u2019s a member of the Good Ol\u2019 Dogs\u2019 Club, he loves spending time with Grape and even has a secret fondness for cats which becomes a plot point in a few of the early arcs. He draws and writes his own comic book, The Adventures of Spot (Superdog).\nGrape, a witty kitty with a mean violent streak. As Peanut\u2019s adoptive sibling, Grape often finds that naps are all but impossible to have when Peanut\u2019s around. Early on, a series of oddly realistic dreams sends Grape and Peanut on a journey of cosmic proportions.\nBino, a local dog, pro tem leader of the Good Ol\u2019 Dogs\u2019 Club, and the most selfish, petty pet in the neighborhood. He\u2019s constantly in the shadow of his more likable older brother Fido and doesn\u2019t like being reminded of it.\nKing, a diminutive complainer with a knack for brooding. While he mostly appears as a Welsh Corgi, in reality he actually used to be a human with animal issues. He is turned into a dog as part of a cosmic game being played by entities of vast supernatural power \u2013 he\u2019s not too happy about that.\nAnd many, many more. Even the Cast page doesn\u2019t list them all (warning: spoilers).\nWriting\nWhile there are over-arcing plot threads, posts usually consist of stand-alone strips or short arcs that follow the antics of one or more characters. Although Peanut, Grape, Bino, and King have the most panel time, the other neighborhood animals get their fair share of attention, too. If you need comparisons, Housepets is something like a mix between Garfield and Peanuts with a touch of Ed, Edd, and Eddy. The comedy is plentiful and the characters are all distinct enough, even with so many of them, that they play off of each other well in most situations.\nBut then a sort of main plot-line is introduced and things start getting a bit crazy \u2013 there\u2019s an ancient temple situated next to a suburban neighborhood, god-like beings playing D&D, other-dimensional realms, and forgotten prophecies. it\u2019s all so out of nowhere that the humor kinda gets dragged down by the weight of it all. Then the comic goes and seems to forget about the mega-arc for half a year. You can\u2019t just introduce a plot thread about an eldritch contest with world-altering consequences right after the arc about visiting the zoo and expect readers to not have a little whiplash. To not even touch on the myth plot again until seventeen arcs later just tests patience. The genius of the comic, however, is that with so many characters you\u2019re bound to find at least one that you\u2019re willing to wait months for just to see again. Scarcity creates value, after all.\nArt\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, but Peanut\u2019s ears and everyone\u2019s enormous paw-mitts from the early strips kind of unnerve me. Even so, the art smooths out fairly quickly, settling on a consistent style until the 16th arc. There are a few episodes of stylistic experimentation every so often after that, but, in the end, Griffin manages to maintain a standard look which improves steadily as time passes. The comic\u2019s usual format is the four-panel strip, but it often stretches into larger layouts, especially recently and in particular with more dramatic or emotionally complicated pages. For the first eleven arcs or so, the strips are in black & white, but following the first Christmas comic every page is in color \u2013 and some pages look gorgeous in it.\nOne fault about the art I can\u2019t ignore is that, while the animals look alright (anthropomorphism aside), humans just look downright terrible. The very few times heads are shown, they look disproportioned, misshapen, and faces look utterly incongruous compared to the otherwise cartoony animal characters. Thankfully, humans appear rarely enough that it isn\u2019t too much of a problem\u2026 but I still can\u2019t help but wish they were more like the adults from Peanuts.\nRun-down\n- Regularly changing art style means it\u2019s always staying fresh if not outright improving.\n- Diverse cast of characters keep it interesting.\n- Good range of humor, not too reliant on animal puns.\n- A bit directionless, with drama, comedy, and romance constantly pulling against each other.\n- Character development is chopped up and spread out; months can go by before a character you like pops up again.\nAll in all, a fun, cute, even touching webcomic, full of great humor and a few scattered episodes of drama. It\u2019s not life-affirming, but, then, neither is Garfield. I\u2019ve kept up with the comic for a couple of years and I thoroughly recommend it if you think you might be interested.\nOh, and if you need a card for Valentine\u2019s Day, Housepets has you covered.\nHousepets is written and drawn by Rick Griffin. This comic, including all images used here, belongs to him. It currently updates Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nNote: Sorry about the late update. What can I say except\u2026 how about that Sochi opening?",

    "context": "I am a reader. Fiction, history, memoirs, biography, history, art history, poetry, and of course books about perfume and nature. I have been accused of living in a world of books. It is the closest thing I know of to time travel. I wish there were 72 hours in the day and I could spend half of them reading. It occurs to me to start perfuming my books, or perfuming the books I give as presents, or perfuming their bookmarks. I am sure some people would howl at this idea, especially those who hate the scent strips in magazines, but it is unlikely those particular people will be opening my books or any books from me any time soon.\nThere are three kinds of fragrances that immediately come to my mind for this use. First, anything with aoud or sandalwood, or some other wood note such as cedar; second, wholesome organic/natural mood enhancing types such Ineke's Balmy Days and Sundays, or Red Flower's Guaiac or Roxana's oak leaf tincture, or certain CB Water perfumes such as Just Breathe, or In the Summer Kitchen, or other herbal, leafy green or tea scents; and third, classic home fragrances such as L'Occitane or Jo Malone's, especially the citrusy or pine-y ones. I also like single note essences and absolutes such as black spruce or galbanum, or even vanilla for this purpose. One drop or two on the opened cover near the spine -- on the wrist of the book, so to speak.\nOn a much lighter side than most perfumes or their close relatives, Le Cherchi Midi's line of home fragrances, based on color and type can be used as room or linen or personal fragrances and would be perfect for books. They can also be used on clothing or the lining of a handbag or leather gloves. They have a clean and sheer nature. None are peculiar or strange in any way so it is highly unlikely they would start to cloy or get on one's nerves over time. Their essential light pleasantness is subtly uplifting, especially during these long indoor-spent cold months. These fragrances are numbered rather than named, and identified with a color corresponding to the type. For example green equals a green fragrance, violet equals an oriental type, black for leather, etc. (The color to fragrance connection is beginning to be examined more frequently in a number of recent releases, I see). White 01 is their ocean/beach signature fragrance with marine air and summer herbal notes. Green o5 is my favorite because of its clear cut-grass air. Violet 09 is a brandy amber which could be useful for certain British mystery and suspense stories. Orange 14 is a light rose and orange flower, very sheer, good for the nineteenth century French chapters that describe the toilette of Madame Bovary or the details of Colette's mother's home in Sido. Black 20 is leather and cedar, perfect for Russian novels and short stories by Turgenev or Chekov, and also Black CT01, vetiver crossed with fir and cedar. 21 Red is a spicey winter holiday scent, cardamon and berries, good for scenting gift wrapped boxes for sweaters and scarves.\nThere are always the perfumes of coffee and tobacco and chocolate, the classic scents to accompany the experience of reading...\nImage above from the On Demand Books site, something new coming which sounds exciting. They will be able to print books to order, single copy, of any book, out of print or never published, current or backlist.\n9 comments:\nhappy 2009!\nI loved the idea of perfuming books.\nI have scented my business cards and my diary.\nfragrant regards from Brazil,\nSimone\nLucy,\nYou are a couple cars ahead of me on the thoughtful train when it comes to scented bookmarks...actually thinking about scenting the books, and on top of that, matching scents to the books. Love it.\nMeanwhile, I continue to use sprayed sample cards as bookmarks...but they just get haphazardly used, because there is never a dearth of reading in progress around here... :) ...and while it means there is not thought into the matchings, it does mean that when I find a completed book with the mark still in, I am transported back to both the reading experience and the more or less concomitant new scent experience.\nAm about to go add a variety to my \"scent pairings\" list...my favorite being from the bar + perfume combinations...\nHey +Q, so you are in Brazil, the land of fragrance...great idea to scent the cards and diaries. I keep my cards in my wallet so maybe the scent would migrate to my money...which would be a-OK...\nDear S -- thank you for your kind words -- It would be an added dimension to find the scents left behind on books read by friends or even clinging to those found used on Amazon or the occasional garage sale...and now I see there is a scent called \"Book Dust\" on Etsy by an artisan perfume maker:\nthough the choice of notes seems a bit different than mine would be. And of course now must try CB's In the Library asap.\ncan you put different scents in different scenes? like music to movies?\nor..\ncan you write a scented narrative for a dog?\nthe possibilites are noseboggling!\nI am loving the scented bookmark idea. I have a beautiful bookmark that I am using right now, with this lovely flower on it. But your idea takes it to a new level. So glad I ran across your blog tonight!\nThanks pikake -- it's so fun to think of further very personal uses for perfume.\nHey Barry,\nI think we may project our own perfume preferences onto books or movies or other characters of psychic important to us but then why not?\nIt's like buying a perfume on a trip, and then you always think of that place when you wear that perfume. It would be like that with a book. Whenever you smell the perfume you have scented your book with, it would transport you to whatever feelings that book evoked from you. Or it would bring alive the characters instantly. So many places to go with this idea!",

    "context": "Overview\nMy Plan of Concentration is a cohesive exposition of the way in which Dostoevsky complicates suffering and the concept of the Other in his work. I open with a succinct paper on Eastern Orthodox Theology, which is intended not to question the foundation of suffering within Orthodoxy but rather familiarize myself and the reader of the differences in the perception of suffering found in the religion itself and the way in which Dostoevsky draws from and complicates aspects of his faith. My second paper is on The Idiot, the thesis of which is predicated on Sarah Young\u2019s use of the term \u201cscripting\u201d and the way the creation of scripts influences and deters Myshkin\u2019s ability to behave with active love to alleviate the suffering of the Other in the Petersburg social setting. My final paper is on The Brothers Karamazov and looks at the repetition of phrases and gestures in that book as they exemplify Dostoevsky\u2019s views. Entitled \u201cSuffering, Brotherhood, and Repetition in The Brothers Karamazov,\u201d the paper explores Dostoevsky\u2019s conception of brotherhood, which presents a Slavophilic and Orthodox-centered conception of equality and union.\nExerpts\nTo understand suffering in a Biblical perspective one must come to terms with the idea that one cannot use an intellectualized human system of morality and justice to judge God. As human - thus imperfect reflections of God and Christ - people must understand Him, and the extent that we cannot, to be beyond understanding. The Book of Job paints this image of God as unknowable in his actions in a cleverly set up dialogue between Job, his friends, and ultimately God. Job, the \u201cperfect and upright\u201d (Job 1.1) man, becomes the victim of God\u2019s conversation with the devil. For the purpose of this paper I will look at the devil as serving a literary role, as a foil for God right now, his role as the accuser, the adversary, and functioning in a parallel fashion to the adversities faced in life.\nDostoevsky does not provide an explanation for suffering. Rather, he claims that suffering can be alleviated and accepted more readily through active love and participation in the brotherhood and unity of all the Russian people. Active love and brotherhood are hampered by our own nature as human beings. Father/son relations, so important in the novel, if absent, lead to great suffering. He deeply complicates this ideal form of living through his use of broken father/son relations and the insect-angel dichotomy found in the vacillations of Ivan and Dmitri.\nAs pointed out and disliked by Nabokov, the overuse and emphasis on the pathetic, of situations built upon pathos, creates an atmosphere in the novel where the break from those pathetic situations affects the reader far stronger and emphasizes the thematic thrust of the novel in a more direct fashion. This break from the pathetic into a movement of grace is evident through the repetition of bows in the novel, as some come in the form of the pathetic and others as a heartfelt union with the Other in brotherly love.\nReflections\nAlthough I intended to study political philosophy at Marlboro, I took a course co-taught by Geraldine Pittman de Batlle and Tom Toleno titled \u201cDreams, Dickens, and Dostoevsky.\u201d In that class I decided I wanted to work on Russian literature with Geraldine.\nI have a few very studious anecdotes but I think the best experience I had in tutorial was at Geraldine\u2019s house. The snow was just beginning to melt with spring, I was trying to edit my 78-page paper on The Brothers Karamazov while Louis played the piano in the background and Geraldine sat at the other table reading each new page as I handed it off to her.",

Route 4 is a zigzag hike through woods, meadows, and moraines, passing the Rifugio Tabaretta (2,556 m, 2 hours) and leading to the col of B\u00e4renkopf (2,877 m); Heading south we will be climbing another col (2,903 m) and arriving at the Rifugio Payer (3,020 m; 3:30 hours). After an overnight stay, we will follow the green markers to cross the rocky ridge west of the Punta Tabaretta, and then descend a narrow col (2,980 m, the top of a huge glaciated channel). We will then climb a rocky wall, exposed and vertical in parts but equipped with fixed chains and climbing aids. This 50-metre climb with a few 2-grade sections is not difficult and climbing to the last spur is facilitated by the use of a fixed spike. After we have reached the shoulder of the glacier (3,100 m approx.) the rest of the pathway is on ice and requires the use of crampons all the way. The track crosses a steep slope leading to the hollow valley of \u00abB\u00e4renloch\u00bb (bear hole), and turning to the right towards the rocks called \u00abTschirfeckfelsen \u00bb (Mount Cief). You can also climb up the steep glacier reaching the Lombardi Bivouac (3,316 m) keeping an eye out for the crevass along the edge of the rocks. We pass a relatively flat shoulder then cross a steep slope diagonally to get to the top of a platform and the snowy ridge (Firn) behind which we reach the cross on the summit (3,905 m; 3\u20134 hours from the refuge depending on conditions). Return via the same route.\nVariante\nRoute to the Rifugio Payer da Traf\u00f2i: from the village (1,541 m) to the sanctuary of Heilige Drei Brunnen (Three fountains, 1,605 m) and on route 18 to the Rifugio Berglh\u00fctte (Borletti, 2,188 m, less than 2 hours). Route 19 north-east takes you up to the col of Tabaretta and continuing south to the Rifugio Payer (from the Rifugio Berglh\u00fctte, 2:30 hours).\nStarting point\nTarget point\nSpecificity\nAn epic ascent reaching an altitude of almost 4,000 metres; suitable for expert mountaineers with previous experience of hiking on rocks and ice, and with a good level of fitness. In summer the Rifugio Payer is often full, therefore prior booking of overnight stay is essential. Attempt this ascent only in good weather conditions and good conditions underfoot.\nParking\nParking is available at Solda - Sulden\nPublic transportation\nPublic bus (Line 271) from Malles - Mals and Spondigna - Spondinig to Solda - Sulden.

There are many secret societies and one of the most powerful ones is the Aegolius Club. James and Charlotte grow up in the country side but James leaves for London to get education and stays there finding lodging with a young aristocrat. When Charlotte does not hear from him for a while she travels to London to find out where he is. There she discovers a hidden world of creatures facing their own troubles. Between the dark alleys of London and the mysterious society of the Aegolius Club there is a lot of politics in which all characters eventually get involved whether they want it or not.\nI did not see that coming... a few weeks ago I read a post by Shannon @ River City Reading about preparing yourself for the next book. I never look for information about the next book being afraid to find spoilers. I check the star rating my friends give a book and I read the blurb and that is it. With that information this book is full of surprises. Obviously you know something is going to happen but you do not know what. If you are like me and love surprises you might want to stop reading this review around here.\nThat were a lot of characters in one story. I am horrible at separating them at one point specially when the one is called Edmund the other Eugene and a Lil and a Liza and help!! So eventually I got James, Charlotte because we started with them and Howland as he was becoming a key figure too. It took me till halfway to get Mould in my head despite him having his own chapters and all the others running around only confused me. I hate it when this happens because I will not really connect with the characters any more when I get to confused. If I don't like the book it is not much of a problem bit I did like this book.\nThe atmosphere is great. I could see the dark streets and the crowds. The people running around. Even with just a little description it simply worked. The idea of the undead and investigation about what they can handle and how they are is not the most original but it was put together in a great way. Reading the new discovery for Mould that holy water and silver do hurt them made me feel his happiness even though my mind told me I know that since forever and could have told him. I did not really like the first set of Mould his notebook chapters early in the book. Though they give an insight on his life there are to many things missing to keep the story fluent with the information I had at that point in the book. I was glad when I got passed them and the story began to move on again. There were a lot of interesting things happening there with underworld politics and research and creepy characters. This story is tied up nicely but there are some open ends for involved characters that might frustrate a reader who likes everything closed.\n1 reacties:Write reacties\nOhh great!Reply\nWell well well, I was trying to tell you that I also enjoyed the book. I thought I couldn't like \"another\" book about these creatures, but I did indeed!\nI was very surprised by \"the surprise\"; I was expecting a totally different book about perhaps a gay relationship.

It\u2019s far better to simply let Dench loose across a worthy cinematic expanse, judging by her mostly silent yet resoundingly brilliant early moments in \u201cVictoria & Abdul.\u201d This sturdy regal period piece provides a perfect opportunity to properly adore the 82-year-old legend as she revisits the role of Queen Victoria two decades after first playing the indomitable monarch in \u201cMrs. Brown.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe occasion is the Golden Jubilee celebration held in 1887 to salute her 50 years of rule over the British Empire. After all the royal celebrants in a cavernous dining hall are seated, Her Majesty\u2014a pudgy figure attired in a heavy black gown that droops like a curtain over her ample backside\u2014slowly waddles her way to the head of a table. Her joyless face is as shriveled and sour as an ancient grapefruit as she wordlessly goes about the ritual as swiftly as possible. As the first course is served, she shovels soup into her mouth at such a rapid pace that liquid sloppily cascades down her chin. Later, she swiftly gnaws through a poultry course like a ravenous lawn mower before sneaking in a cat nap before dessert. Meanwhile, protocol requires that once she is done with a dish, others must cease eating as well.\nBut Victoria\u2019s frown is soon turned upside down when two of her Indian subjects, uprooted from their colonized homeland for the occasion, present her with a ceremonial coin. Both have been warned to not look directly at the queen and Mohammed (Adeel Akhtar, who emits an amusing Paul Giamatti level of disgruntlement), the older and squatter of the pair, follows the rules. But Abdul (Ali Fazal), tall, youthful and quite attractive with a merry twinkle in his eye, can\u2019t help but gaze upon and smile at this lonely old woman. Suddenly, he bends down and kisses her foot. And, just like that, a bolt of mutual affection passes between the queen and the stranger who is about to become her closest companion during the waning years of her reign. That\u2019s when director Stephen Frears, who did so well by Dench with \u201cPhilomena,\u201d finally flashes\u2014ta da\u2014\u201cVictoria & Abdul\u201d upon the screen.\nThose who have seen \u201cMrs. Brown,\u201d the source of Dench\u2019s first of seven (to date) Oscar nominations, will be familiar with Victoria\u2019s relationship with another commoner, Scotsman John Brown (played with robust cheekiness by Billy Connolly), after her beloved consort Prince Albert died. Their connection was more a meeting of the minds as her horse-riding partner would challenge her in a way that others did not dare.\nMost of her advisers treat the aging queen as an obstruction they are forced to indulge, especially eldest son Bertie (a frazzled Eddie Izzard, exasperation incarnate) who is anxious to be king. But what bonds the now-grandmotherly Victoria and Abdul, who has an elegiac way of speaking and viewing the world, is how he approaches her as a human being with feelings and not as an intimidating institution. He also serves as a conduit to India, a part of her kingdom that she is forbidden to visit since a fatwa has been placed on her head. His enchanting description of the Taj Mahal in his hometown of Agra leads her to build an elaborate Indian-themed Durbar meeting room in her seaside house on the Isle of Wight complete with ornate white ceiling, imported rugs and peacock throne.\nAdvertisement\nThe script by Lee Hall (\u201cBilly Elliot\u201d)\u2014\u201cbased on real events\u2014mostly,\u201d we are told\u2014smartly allows moviegoers to discover along with Victoria just who this mysterious charmer actually is. Abdul appears to be forthright but will eventually be shown to be prone to omitting inconvenient truths about his past as need be. Initially, he is promoted to a kind of personal assistant. But as he helps the queen with her daily correspondences, she learns this onetime clerk at a prison is a Muslim and requests that he schools her in his native tongue of Urdu as well as in the Koran. When she learns the word for teacher is \u201cmunshi,\u201d Victoria declares that will now be Abdul\u2019s official position.\nAs the queen grows ever fonder of and more reliant on her new soulmate, tensions rise among those in her inner circle including Michael Gambon as Prime Minister Lord Salisbury, Olivia Williams as Baroness Churchill and Paul Higgins as Dr. Reid, the queen\u2019s personal physician. Race, class and out-sized privilege definitely play a role in stoking their shared resentment of being pushed aside by this foreign outsider to the point that an out-right mutiny is eventually threatened..\nDespite that weakness, there are multiple pleasures to be had by witnessing a powerful, still-vital woman finding unexpected late-life joy of the platonic variety. Sure to bring a smile to anyone\u2019s face is when Victoria and Abdul journey to romantic Florence, where Puccini himself (Simon Callow) sings for the queen and her entourage. In fact, the ruler returns the favor by straining to warble Gilbert & Sullivan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Called Little Buttercup.\u201d Much like this often-endearing portrait of an odd-couple relationship, it is a little off-key but well worth the.",

It\u2019s my blog after all, so I\u2019ll post whatever I want. Now here is a post about movies.\nYou may be aware that there has been a recent remake of Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton, which hit the cinemas last year. I have only recently seen it. The design is incredible, but the kitschy ending somewhat ruined it for me. Anyhow, undoubtedly one of the most memorable parts of the movie is the role of the \u201cRed Queen\u201d aka \u201cQueen of Hearts\u201d. She\u2019s the evil character of the Story, though in a very childlike, vulnerable way.\nNow bear with me for a second.\nAnother movie which I\u2019ve recently seen (again) is The House of 1000 Corpses, a horror flick shot in 2003 by Rob Zombie. It\u2019s a movie about a bunch of teens who get slaughtered by an insane family of murderers and occultists. Here, the most remarkable character of the film is Captain Spaulding, a creepy deranged clown with rotten teeth, played by Sid Haig.\nSo: Two movies. One a 2010 kid\u2019s movie, the other an R-rated, gory horror flick. Now I\u2019d like you to take a look at the two character\u2019s make-up:\nLEFT: The Queen of Hearts, Alice in Wonderland, 2010. RIGHT: Captain Spaulding, The House of 1000 Corpses, 2003.\nThere\u2019s really only two possible ways to explain this similarity. Either it\u2019s coincidence, and Tim Burton was completely unaware that his wife has just been painted with the make-up of a very famous (albeit fictional) serial killer, or he shot a movie for kids that intentionally contained a reference to an extremely violent and brutal horror film. Both scenarios seem equally unlikely. On the one hand, I just cannot believe that Tim Burton is unaware of the existence of the two Rob Zombie movies for it to be purely coincidental. Plus, just look at it. I mean, it\u2019s the exact same shade of blue, arching up from each eye, until confined by a single black line (same thickness!), while the rest of the face is completely white. Somce coincidence that would be. Did the make-up artist allow himself a joke and Tim Burton didn\u2019t notice? Or is this really Tim Burton giving a nod to Rob Zombie in his version of freakin\u2019 Alice ? That would actually make a lot more sense, except that this is something that might potentially set off the \u201cprotect the children!\u201d-reflex of the conservative right, triggering protests, boycotts and attempts at censorship.

The 7D Mark II was released a few years after the 70D, coming with a few features that are a little more advanced. When it comes to the battle between canon 70d vs canon 7d mark ii, both cameras still have some similar features. It is the reason as to why both are still so popular among photographers. Some of the similarities for the cameras are explained below.\nSimilarities between Canon 70D vs. Canon 7D Mark\nMegapixels\nWhen it come doing what they do best, both cameras have a 20-megapixel camera that using the APS-C size CMOS sensor. The size of the megapixels gives both cameras the ability to capture images that are bigger and have high resolution. The maximum resolution for video is 1920 x 1080.\nScreen size\nCanon 70D and Canon 7D Mark II both have a screen of size 3 inches. The type of screen in both units is an LCD with practically the same resoluton the screen resolution. The screens allow for live view, which means that you can take images or shoot videos using the screen. They are also used to display the settings screen and can be utilized for playback as well.\nBuilt-in and external flash\nThe two cameras have in-built flashes, which makes them very great at taking pictures in low light conditions. They are also compatible with external flashes, which is usually preferred if better control of light is desired. They allow capturing of very great shots even at night.\nAutofocus tracking\nThis was a cool feature in the Canon 70D and made its way to the Canon 7D Mark II as well. It allows you to track any movement. Combined with continuous autofocus in both, the features make the two cameras an excellent choice for focusing on moving objects. You are likely to see these cameras with sports photographers.\nEnvironmental sealing\nEnvironmental sealing is a common feature in Canon cameras, with these two not being an exception. They are designed to remain intact and function correctly even in the toughest environmental conditions. That means that you can always take them outdoors for great photo sessions, irrespective of the weather outside.\nGPS enabled\nYou can go on a picture-shooting spree without having to note down the location that you took the picture in after every shot. The GPS can log all the picture locations for you. Wildlife photographers have found this quite a useful feature.",

    "context": "Well, we made a venture down to the town office to ask what we had to do to become a registered and legal farm. We knew that in this day and age farms can benefit from tax breaks and a series of other things. Besides my dearest is a very by-the-books kind of guy. He is so painfully law abiding that he glares at me every time he sees me eat a grape at the grocery store (Hey! I\u2019m not wasting my money if they\u2019re sour!)\nWe want to start this farm out right. I want to make it a poultry farm that raises chicks for local sale and hatching eggs for sale abroad. I\u2019d also be super happy to start an herb and veggie garden aside from all that. So we asked, what does it cost and what do we need to do to make our farm legit? No one had the answer. We went from office to office until we found ourselves at the building inspector\u2019s office. She had a lot to say\u2026 mainly we didn\u2019t own enough land to really be a legitimate farm (5 acres) so we\u2019d have to apply for approval to be a \u201cnon-exempt\u201d farm, a process that\u2019d cost us over $500 and require a board of people to all say yes. Well that didn\u2019t sound good. She said we had to draw up a business plan and tell them every little detail of every activity we planed to do with the farm, our animals, and whatever else was going on on the property. She said make it bigger than we initially plan because whatever we say in this proposal we\u2019ll be held to, by the letter. In other words if we say we\u2019ll have 100 chickens then that\u2019s what we\u2019re allowed to have, no bending the rules after the fact. This greatly annoyed me. It\u2019s an antagonizing thought to the expansive nature of a farm and besides how do I know what we\u2019ll have?! They\u2019re asking us to draw ourselves in a box. Wonderful.\nRight now I have no idea how many chickens we\u2019ll have because I have yet to plant the pasture and set up the rotational fencing to see how many chickens the land can stand before going bald. This is my cap, not some number plucked out of the air, and I have no idea how many chickens this would be. Besides this what else are we going to have that aren\u2019t \u201cjust for personal use\u201d?? I mean I was going to have a small number of ducks, turkeys, and a handful of alpacas to keep the weedier weeds from growing too high but what if we\u2019re bound to that when we for instance discover that goats or sheep are much better at this than alpacas?? Or do we just go all-out nutcase and say we\u2019re opening a zoo for every farm animal known just so we have our asses covered?! (Including the donkey kind!)\nI can\u2019t know exactly what our farm will be doing 4 months from now, much less forever. Do we have to be re-approved every time something is added?? I mean the whole idea of a farm is flexibility. I might have a vegetable garden and a farm stand, I might not. I might get into quail, or sell off extra roosters for dog food, or start teaching others about my methods or general farm knowledge through classes held here, who knows! And as for putting every detail down\u2026 we just moved here. I don\u2019t even know what the market needs or wants. For example I want to sell chicks to the locals in the warmer months but since I haven\u2019t tried selling chicks to anyone I have no idea if there\u2019s any interest or how much, therefore I can\u2019t make a business plan and state how many chicks I will have at any given time because I just don\u2019t know! That depends on the market!\nI\u2019m not feeling too great about this. I am thinking this might be the brick wall I have run into every time I start anything. My beau is unconcerned, stating if it is a problem perhaps we can just buy the land behind us. It\u2019d make us over 5 acres but that\u2019s another 100K, for what? A large lot of completely forested area that makes us look better on paper but does nothing else?? I mean it gives us land to expand to but that\u2019d take a lot of effort and money to do so, not just because it\u2019s wooded but also because we\u2019d need to build access to it going over a huge cliff-like hill. I just don\u2019t know anymore\u2026. I think this is why most little mini farms don\u2019t report anything and just fly under the radar which is exactly what I\u2019d be doing if I weren\u2019t being encouraged to be legitimate by my dearest.

This process would cost over $500 and require a board of people to approve. They also need to draw up a detailed business plan, specifying every activity they plan to do with the farm, their animals, and the property. They are bound by the details of this proposal, with no flexibility for changes. The narrator is unsure about the exact number of animals they will have and the activities they will undertake, making it difficult to draw up a precise plan. They also face the challenge of potentially needing to buy more land to meet the acreage requirement, which would be a significant additional cost.",

Dr. Scott Franklin will move into the Dean\u2019s position and Dr. Trish Trifilo will fill the Director of the Virtual Campus position vacated by Dr. Franklin.\nA biology professor, Dr. Grover came to Wayland in 2008 and was named Dean of the School in 2009. Under his leadership the School has flourished. Grover has played a key role in developing the curriculum for majors in environmental science and environmental studies. He has also placed in emphasis on creation care, and raised awareness of the importance of caring for God\u2019s world through conservation efforts throughout the Wayland system.\n\u201cDr. Grover has certainly taken what was already an outstanding academic school and made it even stronger during his term a school dean,\u201d said WBU Executive Vice President and Provost Dr. Bobby Hall. \u201cHe has grown the distinctiveness of the academic program with emphases on quality, undergraduate research, and field experience.\u201d\nStudents in the math and science departments have benefitted through increased efforts in undergraduate research, as well as field research opportunities. The biology and geology departments regularly take study trips, providing more practical, hands-on educational experiences, and all fields of specialization conduct student research projects and present their findings at national conventions.\nGrover earned his bachelor\u2019s degree at Rider University in 1974 and a master\u2019s from Rutgers in 1977. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of New Mexico in 1982 and came to Wayland after serving as Professor of Biology at Hardin-Simmons University since 1995. He has also served in various teaching and research capacities at the University of New Mexico.\nGrover said the decision to step down as dean is the result of many factors, including the need to move the School into a more technologically driven environment, something he admitted may not be his strength. He also wants to spend more of his time with his personal academic pursuits.\n\u201cI look at the things that need to be done and how they need to be done to move the school to the next level and I see there are better people to accomplish that than me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to invest more of my energy in environmental science areas that interest me.\u201d\nGrover said he hesitates to say he is \u201cretiring\u201d as he hopes this is just another chapter in his academic life.\n\u201cWayland has been the best place I have ever worked in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI could not have asked for a better place to complete the classroom portion of my career. I will continue to be active and write and create things and teach online, but the mountains are calling and my grandkids are calling.\u201d\nWith Grover\u2019s departure, Dr. Franklin will move into the position of Dean of the School of Math and Sciences. Franklin, a 1998 graduate of Wayland, earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Texas Tech University in 2005. He has taught mathematics at Wayland since 2000, and served as Associate Dean under Grover. In 2011, Franklin was named Director of the Virtual Campus.\n\u201cI look forward to continuing the high standards and quality leadership set forth by Dr. Grover,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cOur emphasis in the school has always been on engaging and close interaction between our faculty and our students, and we also closely integrate our faith in the classroom.\u201d\nAs Franklin moves back to the science building, he will leave the virtual campus in capable hands. Dr. Trifilo has been with the VC full time since 2012, serving as the Distance Learning Specialist. Trifilo holds a doctorate in education from Capella University and a master\u2019s degree in science from St. Louis University. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Iowa. Trifilo came to Wayland after working as the director of online learning at Hardin-Simmons University.\nDr. Hall said the transitions to new positions should be seamless with no real disruption in services to students.\n\u201cWayland is indeed fortunate to have the strength, quality and depth among its employees to make these transitions possible,\u201d hall said. \u201cJust as Dr. Grover brought unique strengths to his potion as dean, both Dr. Franklin and Dr. Trifilo are very well prepared to step into leadership rolls.\u201d",

    "context": "Spruce Up Your Exterior Doors\nCare For This Important Focal Point Before Your Holiday Guests Arrive\nBefore guests arrive for the December holidays, homeowners should take stock of their home exterior doors to renew and beautify them to assure years of long-lasting beauty and service.\n\u201cEntry doors are like other key features of the home because they require routine maintenance,\u201d says Chris Maulucci, a technical sales manager with Therma-Tru Corp. \u201cOwners of fiberglass doors enjoy reduced yearly maintenance efforts, but there is still a checklist of items to inspect and adjust periodically on any door.\u201d\nTo help homeowners in knowing what to look for to maintain their entry doors, Therma-Tru has created this checklist:\n- Clean the exterior and interior of the door with a mild soap and water solution.\n- Inspect the weatherstrip and door bottom sweep for wear, and replace as needed.\n- Inspect the door\u2019s corner sill pads for wear, and replace as needed.\n- Check and maintain all the door\u2019s sealants.\nInspect the finish of the door and frame.\n- Reapply paint (for a painted door) or topcoat (for a stained door) as needed, which usually depends on the amount of outdoor exposure the door receives.\n- If needed, adjust the sill cap on the door.\n- Check and adjust the adjustable strike plate for the door as needed so that the weatherstrip is properly compressed when closed.\n- Check the security of the door\u2019s hardware and tighten screws as needed to prevent looseness.\n- Seal the sill cap (the hardwood cap only) with a solvent based sealer, like linseed oil or an oil-based stain.\n- Lubricate door hinges as needed.\nJust as important as the checklist of \u201cwhat to do\u201d for yearly door maintenance is the list of items that homeowners should not do. Therma-Tru offers this list of \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d related to door maintenance:\n- Don\u2019t leave the door unfinished. Doors must be finished (either painted or stained).\n- Don\u2019t paint over a stained woodgrain door without using a compatible primer first.\n- Don\u2019t use lacquer-based paints on doors.\n- Don\u2019t use harsh chemicals to clean doors. A mild soap and water solution is all that\u2019s needed.\n- Don\u2019t use a pressure washer on door exteriors to clean them.\n- Don\u2019t clean the brick around the door with muriatic acid as it will mar the finish if any splashes onto the door.\n- Don\u2019t use caulk to fill in worn weatherstrip. Instead, replace the weatherstrip.\n- Don\u2019t adjust the sill cap too tightly. This can cause the door\u2019s bottom sweep to bind.\n- Don\u2019t change out a doorlite (the glass insert in the door) without using an adjustable torque screw gun placed on the proper setting for the size of the doorlite.\n- Don\u2019t drill holes or screws into the door to hang wreaths or holiday decorations.\nWhat to Look for in a New Door\n\u201cIf, while performing your annual inspection, it becomes apparent that you\u2019re in the market for a new door, consider one made of fiberglass,\u201d says Maulucci. \u201cA solid fiberglass door is up to four times more energy efficient than a solid wood door, plus you get the benefits that fiberglass has to offer, including resistance to rot, rust, dents and weather.\u201d\nAnother factor to consider is what\u2019s on the inside of your door. The dense polyurethane foam used in the core of Therma-Tru fiberglass doors helps the doors achieve high thermal performance values.\nAccording to Maulucci, homeowners choosing to add decorative glass to their Therma-Tru fiberglass doors can also count on energy-efficient features. The company\u2019s triple-pane construction of most.\nBenefits of Fiberglass Doors\nAccording to the American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA), fiberglass products are known for their reliability, customization aspects for style design, and energy efficiency.

I use a King Arms M4A1 AEG with a polymer body. I put a 6\" RIS, some brand rail covers, EOtech holo sight(not military grade mind you), plain vertical grip, 11.1 Li-Po battery with a PEQ box, Magpul MOE stock, and a 6.03 tight-bore barrel on it. I just ordered a Noveske flash hider/amplifier and a hop-up bucking for it. For my sidearm I have an Elite Force 1911 TAC with a flashlight. Sometimes I also use a Wellfire/TSD MB-06 spring sniper rifle.\nMy rig is just a tan Lancer Tactical M4 chest rig and dump pouch with 10 120 rd mid cap mags and an OE Tech quick-draw drop leg holster in black and a rigger's belt for that. I also have a black OE Tech vest with a few pouches on it, but had to purchase the chest rig for Bob vs Tim since Bob's team uses tan.\nNeedless to say I've dumped quite a bit of money into it, but I enjoy it so why not.\nAs for what equipment to get, that depends on you entirely. There's really no set thing you have to have EXCEPT eye protection of course. I use Pyramex V2G-XP goggles. They are only $20 and give you full-seal protection for your eyes and are really comfortable.

However I did know that the course was in good hands with Gil Hanse, who is such a great designer. It was an amzing experience to play it.\n\u201cI actually walked the course last November when it was inaugurated by the City with the Mayor. I think it\u2019s very challenging \u2013 the angles of the greens, the tee shots and especially the landing areas because there is no rough, just former waste land which is now an environmentally protected area.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe greens are small and undulating and I knew it was going to be so tough. I think the quality of grass they used is perfect. The way the ball responded on the greens and fairways, the grass just tees up the ball and it\u2019s a great feeling to hit off that surface. I was excited over every shot I hit.\n\u201cWith the greens and the angles, the course is really fair and rewards your good shots. I thought, with the course being new, I wouldn\u2019t have that type of response but it was great. It was harmonious, it was challenging. You had to think of landing areas and there are holes that encourage you to attack.\u201d\nLovelady pinpointed two holes in particular which caught her eye, the par four 13th and 16th. She continued: \u201cThe 13th is a dog-leg right where you can cut through the trees on the right but not too much. I did that and lost my ball. I was two under at that stage in the Test Event. The other is 16th, a short par four and the long hitters can go for the green but the chip afterwards can be challenging. It was awesome. I really enjoyed it.\n\u201cI would say No.13 is probably the signature hole because the green is really challenging. It\u2019s not an easy approach and the green is so undulating. I also liked the par three fourth. It\u2019s a cool hole.\u201d\nLovelady is praying that as many people as possible come to watch the Olympic golf competitions in person, as well as follow the action on TV. And in the future, she fervently hopes that Rio de Janeiro will have a public golf course to attract a new generation of golfer.\nShe said: \u201cOne of the great things is that someone who is curious to grab a club and a golf ball is going to have access to this. It is a huge first step. The surrounding areas of the course is residential, with high rise buildings. I feel if I was a kid living in one of those buildings and I looked down from on high and saw a golf course that I could go and have access to, I would be really excited. I would be saying; hey mom, hey dad, I want to try that.\n\u201cIn Brazil we are really good in sport. I often see first swings from beginners that are pretty impressive. I really hope they do golf programmes with local high schools to bring the kids into the game for the first time. Now you can rent clubs and I believe it will be a big boost for the sport in our country.\u201d\nDespite her local connections, Lovelady won\u2019t be staying privately with family or friends. She insisted: \u201cI am staying in the Village. I want the full experience. How cool is that? To be with the athletes is so much fun. The girls have been asking me about the course and I tell them it\u2019s so much fun to play and very exciting, but that Rio the city will be, too.\u201d\nPerhaps she might serenade her fellow golfers in the evenings\u2026with a rendition of Girl from Ipanema, surely?",
    "question": "What is Lovelady's connection to golf and how did she get started in the sport?",
    "answer": "Lovelady's great grandfather was one of the founding members of Itanhanga Golf Club and her father introduced her to golf when she was 12. She won local events and went to the United States to play high school golf. She earned a scholarship to play for University of Southern California (USC) and they won the national championships when she studied there.",

It\u2019s fascinating, too, because the composition of the story is highly effective; besides, is not that hard to make rivalry interesting to the audience (especially when it has ties to the reality), as competetiveness hides deep in the human nature, and any appeals to it are bound to be impactful to one degree or another.\nHowever, couple of things should be made clear: first of all, any real-life story adapted for cinema always loses on nuances and details, and this one is no different from the others. Certain accents are emphasized, while others are dimmed from the general view; it\u2019s quite natural, really, \u2013 cinema, like any other art, has its limitations. Second: the story told is a part of a much wider context, which is being completely missed here, and purposefully so. From watching this film one might get a tilted impression that these were 2 greatest racers of their time, when in reality they shared their place under the sun with several others just as great. It is completely understandable why the story had to be processed this way, but still.\nGenerally speaking, though, it\u2019s a very good film, as well as a wonderful entertainment.

Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it's Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\nSA = Sexual Assault\nST = Sex Trafficking\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\n*Children\u2019s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\n*DV Community Education \u2013 1989,\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney\u2019s Office 1992 to 2002,\n*Crisis Intervention Team.

Sistahs\u2019 Caf\u00e9 & Deli\u2013 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\n*Programs & Services\n*Who We Service",

    "context": "Do you let your dog on the couch/bed?\n.\nMy husband lets our dog on the couch, and this really bothers me. We have a baby on the way, and I am especially conscious of germs. When we take our dog out, she\u2019ll pee, and then turn around and step in her pee\u2026 not to mention she (obviously, lol) doesn\u2019t wear underwear \u2013 meaning her \"business end\" is right on the couch, likely getting all sorts of wonderful germs on the couch that I\u2019m sure nobody would want their child getting in his or her mouth. I\u2019m fine with having the dog, that isn\u2019t the question, but my husband doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with letting the critter on the couch whereas I see something horribly wrong with it for the sake of our soon-to-be newborn (mind you newborns don\u2019t have much of an immune system at first).\nDo you have any suggestions? Any resources or facts about germs animals transfer to furniture or anything like that?\nI don\u2019t see much of anything wrong with letting her on the couch/bed unless she tears it up. And don\u2019t worry about the baby. Unless your child has a condition where the slightest germ can make him/her sick, you shouldn\u2019t worry about the dog getting him/her/ sick. \ud83d\ude42 I work with babies and most of their families have pets and I haven\u2019t heard any stories of the pets getting them sick.\nBut if you are worried about it, you should ask your doctor and it might be a good idea to consult a vet. and see what they might say about it.\nAnd congratulations!!!\nYou have nothing to worry about. As far as every day germs go, i see your point. Our vet told me that dogs can\u2019t give humans colds or anything. But to be on the safe side, you can keep your dog off the bed/couch if you are really worried about the germ factor. However, if you want your dog to remain on the couch/bed, you could give her her own bed, or blanket to put on these surfaces.\nCongrats on the baby!\ni let my dogs on the couch and my bed, but there isnt any young childer in my home so its not a prob for my family.\ni would suggest you start training your dog to stay off the couch soon tho\nGood Luck:)\nYes, my dog is allowed on our couch and my bed. I don\u2019t believe they transfer germs.\nYes, all my pets are allowed on the beds/couches. They are a big part of my home and family.. so of course they are allowed on there!.\nThe baby is going to be in a crib or basinett anyways.. why does it matter if the dogs are on the couch/bed?\nI have a maltese and she sleeps on the bed with me.. But if she is a big dog, and she is walking in her urine, i would say there are chances she can get infected. Go to your vet every few months to have check-ups. If they find worms, keep her quarantined away from the baby, and clean her messes.\nYou could wipe her feet when she comes in, and we bought a \"snuggy\" blanket (not a snuggy, an actual blanket.) from petsmart that matches our living room and she sleeps on that!! hahaha.. oh and having a dog around a baby, reduces their chances of allergies!\nno dnt let her up!! germs and shedding will occur. and specially with a baby on the way o no no no!! just suggest it calmly first and then if he says no just get a little more stern everytime you say it. goodluck\nYou need to talk to your husband. I never let my female dog on the couch nor the bed, because I just want her to know that I have my place and she has hers (which is a pet bed beneath the couch). I also try to avoid dominance problems this way. It\u2019ll be hard to reteach your dog that she is not allowed anymore on the couch, because a habit is hard to break. But you need to reteach her ASAP, because some dogs get jealous of babies.\nEdit: Teach her the word \"off\". Everytime she jumps the couch put her down gently and as her paws touch the floor say \"off\". She will catch it pretty soon.\nYes my dogs are on the couch and the bed.\nIf you were really scared of germs might I add the getting pregnant part is not the most sterile of circumstances, talk about germs.\nYou think dogs have germs, wait til you clean a few diapers from that kid.\nThis is just an excuse for you to get rid of your husbands dog, I suggest you drop it.\nResources- dog germs are not harmful to children, I would worry more about my dog getting kid germs\nYes. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. You come into more contact with germs in your kitchen than you do with your dog. Seems to me you\u2019re just being nitpicky about the dog.\nEdit\nAduial basically said what I was thinking.\nMy sis has two baby boys and they turned out fine and the dogs are on the couches a bunch!\nYes I let my dogs up on the bed and couch. It doesn\u2019t bother me. You do realize that you don\u2019t come into contact with any more germs from that then you do anyway. Having a dog on the couch doesn\u2019t mean there are more germs in your house than there are if it was on the floor. So I don\u2019t really see your argument.\nNo I don\u2019t let my dogs on my couch or my bed. Germs are probably not going to be a major issue. My dogs aren\u2019t allowed on the bed or couch because it\u2019s disrespectful and not polite.\nI let my dog on the couch but rarely on the bed. However, if I were expecting a baby, I really would not know what to do. I can understand your concern. That would scare me too.",
    "question": "What are some of the suggestions given to the concerned individual about their dog being on the couch?",
    "answer": "Some suggestions given include consulting a doctor or vet about the potential germ transfer, training the dog to stay off the couch, providing the dog with its own bed or blanket to put on the couch or bed, wiping the dog's feet when it comes in from outside, and teaching the dog the command \"off\" to keep it off the couch.",

Friday his class gave the speaker $1,000 \u2013 to buy more livestock. The money is for Heifer International to use to help hungry people around the world raise and cook food.\n\u201cYou\u2019re igniting a hopefully deeper faith \u2013 on both sides,\u201d said the sixth-graders\u2019 computer teacher, John Kottori, who\u2019s working with Mrs. Chase and planning a lesson called \u201cFaith 2 Faith.\u201d He said it\u2019s about \u201cunderstanding these communities that really need these animals to survive, and, through our faith, wanting to do something, in hopes the people receiving these animals realize the ones that helped them have the same faith. It\u2019s got to start with our faith: understanding, caring and action.\u201d\nJohn Perkins, Heifer International\u2019s area volunteer coordinator for central Massachusetts, a member of Our Lady of the Angels Parish, said he spoke to the class last fall. Then they visited Heifer Farm in Rutland, one of Heifer International\u2019s learning centers.\n\u201cThey actually got to milk the goats, collect chicken eggs and spin some wool,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe inspired them,\u201d said Mrs. Chase, who was teaching them about world hunger for their school service project this year. The day after he spoke, Nolan brought in his own money, which started the collection, she said.\n\u201cI was hoping we could raise some money,\u201d she said, noting that she coordinated a similar collection for Heifer International at the school some years ago. \u201cI wanted to make the kids aware of what people have and don\u2019t have. It was right before Christmas and this was a Christmas collection.\u201d\n\u201cIn lieu of gifts to the teacher\u201d the sixth-graders brought donations for Heifer International, Mr. Perkins explained.\nThe 30 students brought in more than $400, she matched it, and someone else gave $200, Mrs. Chase said.\n\u201cI\u2019m ecstatic that they can actually have an impact,\u201d she said of the students.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of them,\u201d Mrs. Chase said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy doing this. \u2026 There was a big discussion about the best way to spend the money\u201d to benefit the most people.\nThe decision? A flock of chicks, ducks and geese; three goats, a pig, a llama, two beehives, an irrigation pump and two bio-gas cooking stoves.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen stoves like these in action,\u201d he said. The stoves are important because cooking over an open fire is bad for people\u2019s health and for the environment, he said. Some people will be really grateful \u201cyou helped them with that,\u201d he said.\nHe told of a study Heifer International did in Thailand looking at what some of its projects accomplished.\n\u201cThey found people had greater food variety, better nutrition, better health,\u201d he said. This, and the various types of improvements in other countries, enabled more children to attend school. He said education is a way to help end poverty.\n\u201cFor every year a girl goes to school, her income increases by 20 percent,\u201d (double that of the boys), he said. \u201cWhen we get better food into people, they learn better.\u201d\nHe also praised how the OLA students learn. He said that during his fall presentation, \u201cThey were so responsive I did something I normally do with high school kids \u2013 a visualization of what it\u2019s like to live in poverty. I basically take them to visit a family in Honduras I knew.\u201d\nHe has students imagine removing from their lives seven things \u2013 including things such as electricity, food and health care. They learned the lesson well and responded.\n\u201cAnd the last thing you take away from them is hope,\u201d he said, explaining that one of the family members died.",

None of this civil partnership stuff, we're talking; a full wedding in a church, with a vicar and religious vows marriage \u2013 finally!!\nI\u2019m thankful that the UK is one of the most accepting and liberal countries in the world, but there is still a lot of judgement, prejudice and sometimes hatred towards homosexual people \u2013 It.drives.me.crazy!\nOne of my most favourite people in the world is my cousin, I knew he was gay from the moment I understood what \u201cbeing gay\u201d was, as did our entire family, but he didn\u2019t officially come out until his late twenties and living with his then boyfriend.\nI have said to him since, that it drove a small but significant wedge between us for a while, to which he replied that, despite our closeness he was scared his paternal and maternal families would reject him \u2013 even in the 21st Century. I was surprised, but not shocked, especially after seeing a statistic that; a fifth of all people in the UK wouldn't attend a gay wedding.\nWith the big hit of the First Kiss film, on Youtube, a new clip has been uploaded.\nHomophobic people were asked to hug gay people. It\u2019s incredibly interesting to watch as there are conversations like \u201cHow do you kiss another Guy?\u201d Answer: \u201cThe same was you kiss a girl!\u201d and statements such as \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty to be gay\u201d. They're gay, not aliens.\nWatch below.\nAt a baby shower I went to recently, my friend\u2019s Mother-in-law and I were chatting about everything from weddings, babies, TV, Movies, Food and the subject of homosexuality. Although I didn\u2019t expect her to be quite as blunt, she hit the nail on the head; \u201cThe only difference between being gay or straight is how many genitals are in the bedroom\".\nLast week, there was a programme aired called Cure Me I\u2019m Gay. In the show, celebrity Doctor Christian Jessen, who is openly gay, tried all manner of weird and disgusting \u201ccures\u201d for his sexuality. From self help books, therapy and a disgraceful treatment where he was basically poisoned whilst looking at sexual photos and a tape playing messages that say \u201cBeing Gay in wrong\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural\u201d playing in the room. This treatment was available on the NHS until the 1980\u2019s and it left Dr. Jessen in tears and humiliated.\nIn another ridiculous treatment, Dr. Christian was asked to colour in a picture of his brain, the colours apparently showed how gay he was and in the subsequent following sessions, his colour preferences would turn to \u201cstraight colours\u201d.\nAfter watching the documentary I had a text conversation with my above mentioned cousin, which went like this:\nMe: Did you watch the Cure Me I\u2019m Gay documentary?\nCousin: No, why? Any good?\nMe: Well, apparently we can cure your gay-ness by getting you to do some colouring in!\nCousin: I\u2019ll get my felt tips ready!\n......24 hours later\nMe: Have you done your colouring it yet? Are you straight now?\nCousin: I\u2019m about as straight as a circle!!\n...and I wouldn\u2019t have him or any of my gay friends and family, any other way!\nL x",

In a big way.\nEve has most recently played on the Trinidad National Senior Team where Pantalione watched him on television.\nA telephone call from a four-year coach in New York, coupled by an arduous 60-day recruiting process, enabled Yavapai to land what might be the school's most prolific player since Edson Rico, who put the vaunted program on the map in its first year, 1989.\n\"I'm very excited ... needless to say,\" Pantalione said Wednesday, shortly after making the signing official.\n\"He's a very versatile player with an abundance of international experience. I think he'll add a lot of maturity to our team as well as a lot of speed, quickness and unselfishness, with big-time goal-scoring ability as well.\"\nSuch a description also fits Rico to a tee. And Pantalione hopes that Eve's presence will be the fit necessary for YC to get back to the days that Rico introduced -- namely, that of winning national championships.\nYavapai has an eight-year overall record of 170-10-6, and has finished runner-up nationally each of the past three seasons.\nBut it's been five years since it has visited the national winner's circle, a drought that seems like forever to a program of this caliber.\n\"We put this team together to beat Mercer and teams like Mercer,\" said Pantalione, whose team is ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll and begins practice Wednesday.\n\"Now it's time to cooperate and make it all work.\"\nEve is the second player to come to Yavapai from Port of Spain, the other being former All-American goalkeeper Chris Sagar.\nBut he isn't the first Roughrider to come from Trinidad, and those who did are all familiar with his abilities.\n\"I talked to Chris Sagar recently and he told me, 'coach, he'll help you win a national championship,'\" Pantalione said.\nReturning midfielder Kevin Jeffrey (current YC player from Trinidad) described Eve as being \"A lot better than me.\"\nAnd another former YC star from Trinidad, Avery John, labels him as \"The real deal.\"\nAll help covince Pantalione of exactly what kind of player he's getting. But ...\n\"We haven't had an Edson Rico since Edson Rico,\" Pantalione said. \"But the way I look at it ... actions speak louder than words.\"\nEve joins 11 other freshmen recruits and 11 sophomores on the '97 squad.",

    "context": "Things to do around Barcelona\nBarcelona, a part of the charm and beauty of this city is that it is surrounded by many wonderful places that you can visit, especially if you\u2019ve already been to the city a few times before and are looking for something new. If you\u2019ve never been to the Catalan capital before then it may be best that you check out the Barcelona accommodation on offer in the city center and plan a trip within the city walls. Otherwise, to get the most out of your trip, you can rent an apartment that will enable you to see the best of the inner city and the surrounding area by renting a bit further from the center. You\u2019ll save money too as quality apartments away from the center are cheaper to stay in.\nGirona\nThe city of Girona is 100km from Barcelona and was founded as in 77BC, as such, this beautiful place has a rich history. You can stroll through the picturesque streets around the center and see the cathedral with the largest gothic nave in the world. You can also take photos of the charming characteristic houses which stretch across the river.\nCosta Brava\nOne of the best places to visit across Barcelona, full of an array of destinations. This region consists of 200 miles of coast north of Barcelona, from Blanes to Portbou. There\u2019s a varied landscape too, from small fishing villages to medieval towns and mid-sized cities. If you had to choose only 2 places to visit though, then it\u2019s recommended you check out Tossa de Mar and Roses.\nFigueres\nYou can find Figueres 136 km from Barcelona. It\u2019s one of the most important cities on the Costa Brava and capital of the region Alt Emportd\u00e0. The importance of visiting this location is owing to the fact that it was the birthplace of Dal\u00ed, and in every corner, you can practically breathe in his art. It is, therefore, home to an impressive Dal\u00ed museum, with the best of surrealist art on show.\nSitges\nThe town of Sitges is another place to visit near Barcelona. There are many medieval elements of the town that are still preserved and it has a rich cultural heritage because it was a landmark place for modernist intellectuals.\nMonta\u00f1a de Montserrat\nThe mountain of Montserrat is one of the most interesting places to visit near Barcelona. It\u2019s practically an icon of the city, and of Catalonia too. Here you will find the famous monastery which houses a statue of the Virgin Mary, black, the patron saint of Catalonia.\nLa Monta\u00f1a de la sal \u2013 CardonaBarcelona surrounding areas\nIn English, it translates to \u201cThe Salt Mountain\u201d is a monument geographically located close to Barcelona and is exactly what it says that it is. It\u2019s little over an hour away from Barcelona. These salt mines were one of the most important exports in Europe. They are found in the \u201cParc Cultural de la Muntanya de Sal\u201d, which were founded in 1997. In front of the min is the Castle of Cardona, built between the ninth and twelfth century. A location well worth visiting.\nNext time you land in the Catalan capital, you don\u2019t have to settle for just seeing the city. Expand your horizons, and tour the entire region of Barcelona. It\u2019s recommended that if you want to do this then you should rent a car. If for whatever reason you can\u2019t, then some of the places are well connected with public transport (like Montserrat, Sitges, Girona) but you\u2019ll have to plan in advance. Once you\u2019ve exhausted the Barcelona region you can even consider moving on to Madrid, where you can stay in a Madrid apartment.",

    "context": "David Crowe, attorney at law, believes someone should stand up for the rights of bicycle riders. And with more than 200 bike-related cases under his belt, the former pro cyclist may be just the man to take up the torch.\nWhen cyclists are hit by cars and become entangled in haggling with insurance companies over medical costs or wrecked bikes, that's when Crowe -- Athens' best-known bicycle barrister -- steps in and either files suit or negotiates a settlement. Of 50 cases Crowe has taken to trial involving cars vs. bikes, he's lost exactly zero. Now, about 80 percent of defendants will settle before they risk their case in front of a jury.\nHe's become so well-known for his legal acumen in biking circles that local bike shop owners and clerks keep his business card on hand and have been known to shout Crowe's name out as they ride by cyclists who've taken a spill -- ''Go see David Crowe!''\nCrowe, 38, has practiced personal injury law for 11 years, including the past six years on his own. A former rider for the Athens Bandag national team, he still takes a mountain bike trek every summer in Montana.\nCrowe's specialty of bicycle litigation came as a natural mix of his hobby and career. Retired from the road race circuit and fresh out of law school at Cal Western San Diego, Crowe began hearing story after story from fellow Athens bike riders who felt they were wronged in collisions with cars.\n''Nine times out of 10, the bicycle is going to be blamed for the wreck,'' Crowe said. ''It was really an unbelievable pattern. Even in the most egregious cases, the officers would find fault with the rider.''\nThere are two types of car-bike collisions that are most common on the road, Crowe said. In one scenario, a motorist will zip around a bicycle rider and attempt a right turn in front of the bike. The other most common instance is when a motorist simply doesn't see a cyclist and turns left in front of the rider. In both cases, the cyclist meets sheet metal in a hurry.\n''In every single case, I've never seen a motorist cited,'' Crowe said.\nHe believes there is a standing bias among many motorists, jurors and police against bicycle riders, though with the advent of bicycle police, ''the pendulum is swinging back a little bit,'' he said.\n''A lot of motorists think if they see a bicycle on the roadway, it really should not be there,'' Crowe said. ''They think the cyclists need to get out of their way.''\nGene Dixon, owner of Dixon's Bicycles in Athens, said it only takes a few folks with negative attitudes toward cycling to create a bad atmosphere for riders.\n''I don't think the percentage (of people with bias) is that high, but it doesn't take that many people with that attitude to create that feeling on the roads,'' Dixon said.\nInsurance adjusters often scoff when they get damage estimates from Crowe for high-end bikes mangled in auto collisions. Representing serious road cyclists with serious equipment, Crowe has sought property damage compensation for bikes costing as much as $5,000.\n''When we send these estimates in for the amount of damage, generally adjusters call and say, 'I think you've misplaced a decimal point,' '' Crowe said.\nDixon, who has appeared in court as an expert witness for Crowe, said lowballing by insurance companies is typical in bike accidents.\n''It's really easy for an insurance company to want to try to do that,'' Dixon said. ''There is that attitude that I don't think these (cyclists) have the resources to defend themselves, so we'll try to nail them. David comes in and stands up for them.''\n''We're very reasonable in what we ask for,'' Crowe said, ''but on the other hand, we don't lay down and allow ourselves to be run over.''\n''The nice thing about David is he's a cyclist, so he understands not only what the equipment is worth, he also knows a lot of inside things about cycling that maybe a normal attorney wouldn't know,'' said Steve Sevener, a professional cyclist who runs Atlantis Hydroponics on Baxter Street.\nCrowe helped litigate two cases in which Sevener was struck by a car on his bike. Sevener said Crowe, who is also known for his encyclopedic knowledge of Athens roads, has ''helped just about everybody I know when it comes to bikes.''\n''Aside from being a cyclist, and knowing what they have to deal with on the road, he's really a good attorney and in tune with the cyclist's needs,'' Sevener said.\nCrowe said that while he always has at least one or two bicycle accidents among his caseload, they only account for about a third of his business. Many cases, especially those involving only property damage, bring in little money.\n''In many cases, I don't expect to earn much income off of it, I'm just advocating the rights of cyclists,'' said Crowe. ''If someone wants to call up and talk about cycling, they'll get in right away.\"",

Meet, then, the keyboard equivalent of comfort food or your favorite pajamas: We suspect few folks would find one of the most recent Corsair Vengeance-family keyboards not to their liking were it to show up on their desk.\nWe recently reviewed the Corsair Vengeance K70, a gaming-centric keyboard with red backlighting and Cherry MX Red mechanical key switches, and graced it with our Editors' Choice award. The red illumination makes it look especially like a gamer's keyboard, but we found it would also work well for productivity use or those who simply like the specific sensitive touch of its mechanical key switches. (It's now available in other switch types and colors.)\nThe look was edgy but classy, too. The K70 and other, earlier keyboards in Corsair's Vengeance line (the Vengeance K60 and K90) have a very distinctive design feature: keys that \"float\" above the key bed, with no enclosing framework around them. The design reminds us of a \"skeleton\"-style wristwatch design, in which the ticking internals are the design, put out for show.\nThe Vengeance K95 keyboard we're reviewing here is the latest flagship of the Vengeance line, introduced in late 2013. It takes the K70 and steps up matters a few notches, with an oversize design, a truckload of dedicated shortcut keys, and handsome, highly customizable backlighting that\u2019s surprisingly tasteful. One of the most attractive consumer keyboards we've tested to date, to our eyes, the Vengeance K95 bridges gamer must-have features and productivity-centric smarts and respectability in a keyboard that, while no doubt pricey, could work well in both worlds\u2014say, in a home office that turns into a den of Skyrim at night. (The MSRP on this board is $159.99, and it was selling for just $10 or so less from most online sellers when we wrote this.)\nAcross the keyboard, Corsair pulled out almost all the stops. You can now backlight the keys on a per-key basis, and the weighty volume roller that we liked so much in the Vengeance K70 is present here, too. Beyond the big bank of shortcut keys (which themselves can each serve up three shortcuts, thanks to three macro \"profile set\" keys, dubbed M-States) is a further spate of extras: dedicated media-playback keys and brightness controls, and some highly intuitive software for programming your game or application shortcuts.\nTaken together, the feature set and execution of the K95 makes it both a great gaming keyboard and a great productivity keyboard, assuming you are looking for both and like the Cherry MX Red keyfeel. (That was the only key flavor available for the K95 when we wrote this in January 2014.)\nMechanical Keyboards: The Basics\nWith that keyfeel thought in mind, a few words about mechanical keyboards. We know: In a certain sense, all keyboards are mechanical, but the term has a specific meaning in the keyboard realm.\nIf you're unfamiliar with these kinds of keyboards, you're in for a treat. They are nothing new; mechanical computer keyboards have been around since the 1980s, in the likes of the Northgate OmniKey or IBM Model M keyboards, two models legendary for their distinct feel, clackety feedback, and near-indestructibility. Mechanical keyboards use a special kind of switch\u2014the actual mechanism under each key\u2014that contributes to their very distinctive feel under your fingers, not to mention their premium prices. (You won't find many mechanical keyboards on the market these days for under $80.)\nLess expensive keyboards typically use what's known as \"rubber dome\" or \"membrane\" technology, in which each key has beneath it a dome made of some springy material, or a sheet of such material covered with hemispheric bubbles. The rubber or similar stuff provides the force that gives each key its springiness. As a result, pressing one of these keyboards' keys, you generally get a mushy keyfeel. Mechanical keys, on the other hand, have a different aesthetic due to their discrete, spring-feedback switches, which come in several types.\nBy far the most common kind of switches used in consumer mechanical keyboards are the MX family of switches made by Cherry Corp., and these switches are popularly differentiated by \"color\": most commonly, MX Brown, MX Red, MX Blue, and MX Black. Each color has its own actuation force and clickiness (or lack thereof). Again, you\u2019ll find that your ideal switch is a personal preference, though gamers tend to graduate toward MX Red (low actuation force, less clicky) and typists toward MX Blue (very clicky, with good feedback). MX Black is essentially a stiffer MX Red, while MX Brown is a midpoint between light-feel MX Red and clickier, stiffer MX Blue.\nGiven that these are investment-grade keyboards that typically cost a bit above or below $100, and with key switches rated for tens of millions of key presses, you'll likely be living with your mechanical keyboard for a long time to come. So, more than any other kind of input hardware, it\u2019s well worth trying some mechanical keyboards of different switch types before you buy, if you can get your mitts on them in a store..\nComputerShopper may earn affiliate commissions from shopping links included on this page.

    "context": "Thoughts on Basic (and Not-So-Basic) Writing\nSo far in my graduate course this semester, among other readings, I've assigned Mina Shaughnessy's introduction to Errors and Expectations, an excerpt from Robert Connors' Composition-Rhetoric: Backgrounds, Theory, and Pedagogy, an excerpt from Ken Macrorie's Telling Writing, and David Bartholomae's \"Inventing the University.\" These four I mention are really forming a constellation in my mind about teaching academic writing to beginners, especially the place of grammar, that dude who just will not leave the party.\nFor one thing -- as I'm pleased the students in class picked up on -- when most people say \"grammar,\" they don't mean only grammar. It's a shorthand, umbrella term for a lot of organizational, rhetorical, and stylistic conventions that the user of the term \"grammar\" doesn't know how to articulate. Every time I read Bartholomae's essay (PDF), I'm re-impressed with how well he describes and demystifies the gestures and postures in academic writing.\nI'm interested in looking at these readings with the question in mind of how basic writing should be taught. The approaches in the article I linked here are categorized well, but I have been thinking of two basic categories:\n1. The Sequential Method\nThis approach has the goal of getting rid of sentence-level errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation (GSP). When the writing is clearer in this regard, the instruction can then proceed to issues of genre, argument, etc. Proponents, at least the ones I've talked to, sometimes make the \"you have to learn to crawl before you can learn to walk\" comparison, which, by the way, isn't true for babies. Writing assignments may be sentences or paragraphs as well as essays; there's a pretty well-established collection of \"paragraphs and essays\" writing textbooks, many with GSP worksheets and exercises, tailored for this approach.\n2. The Tandem Method\nThis approach, which seems to be favored in the scholarship I've read, calls for students to learn GSP and conventions of academic writing concurrently, so students would learn about making claims with reasons supported by credible evidence, analyzing audience, academic genres like annotated bibliographies, etc.* while learning GSP, but only the GSP the specific student needs to learn. The student may have subject-verb agreement mastered, so no sense spending time on that, but still need help in semicolon usage, for instance.\n*OK, so maybe not a lot of Basic Writing teachers are assigning full-on annotated bibliographies. But still, the tandem method does have students focus on content and organization of whole essays from the beginning of the course.\nI have more to say on this topic, but right now I'd rather go to sleep. I'm interested in exploring the possible advantages of each of the two methods. So far I have, for the sequential method: maybe the students whose GSP is improved after a course taught this way (and the research suggests there aren't many of those) are in a better position because some of the teachers they'll have in the future will be more positively predisposed toward them, more willing to believe that these students have intelligence and are not lost causes, and more willing to make the effort to teach the argument, analytical skills, genre conventions, and so forth.\nBW and Annotated Bib\n2 Board Alley\nI teach the lower of two levels of Basic Writing at a community college, and here's what I've learned over the years. I teach \"grammar\" in tandem--or context with their writing. Otherwise, I wind up with students who can recognize error on tests but not in their own work. Whenever we go over a concept in grammar, I immediately ask the class to either write their own examples or open a file and find examples of what we've gone over. It's the ability to apply the concept or recognize the patterns in their own work that I'm after.\nIt's also tricky to teach \"grammar\" to students whose definition of \"revision\" means \"handing over a paper to a teacher who will make all of the corrections so that you can correct your mistakes.\" In that context, real revision (as well as responsibility for the paper)seems like busywork, and the only valuable, important learning is in the worksheets.\nSome of this behavior may also be rooted in the fact that it is far easier to fill out a worksheet than it is to puzzle out a paper.\nAnd, I don't know if your university-level basic writers are the same as the ones I teach, which would make all of the above irrelevant.",

    "context": "NBA Trade Rumors: Latest Buzz on Carmelo Anthony, Brandon Knight and MoreJuly 17, 2017\nThe 2017 edition of the NBA offseason has been an entertaining one. While it's often the NFL that commands the summer offseason, basketball has remained front and center ever since the end of the NBA Finals.\nThe offseason began with a stellar draft class and some headline-grabbing trades and has continued to shine throughout an entertaining summer league. Even as we enter the second half of July, media attention remains high thanks to the possibility of some more notable moves.\nMany of the biggest tradable players of the offseason\u2014like Chris Paul, Paul George and Jimmy Butler\u2014have already been moved. However, there are still some notable guys who could be traded. We're here to examine the latest trade buzz as the offseason continues.\nCarmelo Trade Still a Possibility\nCarmelo Anthony remains the most notable name on the trade market. He was the subject of trade rumors before Phil Jackson was ousted as team president, and he remains at the center of them even now. The reason for this is that Anthony is an aging veteran, and the New York Knicks are looking toward yet another rebuild.\nThe fact Anthony is set to earn $54 million over the next two seasons doesn't exactly help his value with the retooling Knicks either.\nHowever, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that the Knicks were putting trade talks on hold. The team had been involved in talks with both the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2014the two teams Anthony is interested in joining via trade.\nAnthony holds a no-trade clause in his current contract.\nWhile Shelburne and Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are interested in getting Anthony to return to the team, this doesn't mean a trade won't eventually happen. In fact, per Wojnarowski, Anthony is counting on the Knicks to resume talks him, league sources said.\"\nThe one thing the Knicks may be able to rely on is the fact Anthony previously expressed his desire to remain in New York in order to be close to his son. It's not as if the team can sell him on championship aspirations. The team can, however, try selling him on a playing environment.\nTrail Blazers, McCollum Getting in on the Carmelo Chase\nThe Cavaliers and the Rockets are the two teams Anthony has expressed interest in joining this offseason. However, that hasn't stopped other teams\u2014or individual players\u2014from trying to recruit Anthony.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers had previously been linked to Anthony as part of a three-team deal involving New York and Houston. However, Wojnarowski recently reported that Portland would instead prefer to land Anthony:\n.\"\nPortland squeaked into the playoffs last season with a .500 record, so it might be presumptuous for the team to believe it can compete with the likes of the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference just be adding Anthony. However, it the Trail Blazers do feel they can be title contenders with Anthony, it would make zero sense to facilitate his trade to Houston.\nTrail Blazers shooting guard C.J. McCollum got in on the recruiting action\u2014and had a little bit of fun\u2014over the weekend. He posted a Photoshopped picture of Anthony wearing a Portland uniform on his Instagram account, tagging Anthony in the photo.\nWhile McCollum's post isn't likely to sway Anthony too much, it might be a reminder that some teams want him\u2014after the Knicks spend a large part of the offseason acting like they don't.\nKnicks Looking to Add a Point Guard\nWhile the Knicks may ultimately trade away Anthony, they're also reportedly looking to acquire talent. According to Ian Begley of ESPN, New York is looking to add a point guard. Per Begley, Brandon Knight of the Phoenix Suns has come up in trade discussions, both as an addition and as part of a Carmelo deal:\n.\"\nKnight averaged 11.0 points, 2.4 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game last season. He would presumably be a short-term option as New York develops rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina.\nMarc Berman of the New York Post reported last week that the Knicks had inquired about both Bledsoe and free agent Ramon Sessions.\nSessions would likely be a last-ditch value option for the Knicks, assuming the team is looking for a starting point guard. The 31-year-old averaged just 16.2 minutes and 6.2 points per game last season. Knight and Bledsoe\u2014who averaged 21.1 points and 6.3 assists last season\u2014would appear to be better primary options.",

    "context": "I lost my heart to Orkney years ago. I think at first it was the tranquility and the silence. Then it was realising the silence (compared to a city I mean) isn\u2019t as quiet as I first thought; the birds, the wind and the waves are the sounds of Orkney, and I grew to love it even more. That was my first trip; on the second trip I got engaged at the Ring of Brodgar, so what was already a special place for me became even more so for us.\nThe second best thing to being there, is reading about Orkney through the words of Orcadian writer George Mackay Brown. \u2018Vinland\u2019 might make its way onto my list of all-time favourite books. It is utterly stunning to read and I want more. I\u2019m not familiar with Mackay Brown\u2019s poetry, and the only other book I\u2019ve read by him was \u2018Beside the Ocean of Time\u2019, which I will have to pull off the shelf again, but after reading \u2018Vinland\u2019 not only did I want the story to go on and on, I also want to see what else he wrote.\nThis the reaction I want when I finish reading a book. If I put off reading the last few pages because I don\u2019t want the tale to ever end, it is for me the sign of a perfect book. The book is set in the Medieval Scandinavian world, including Orkney, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, and Ireland, as well as North America. The title \u2018Vinland\u2019 is a little bit misleading, as only part of it is set in North America, when Leif Ericson tried to settle a colony there, however the dream of Vinland is carried on throughout the protagonist\u2019s life.\nThe book charts the life of Ranald Sigmundson, a boy who goes to sea with his father, and ends up with Leif Ericson in Vinland. He returns home to Orkney, and evens goes to war in Ireland. I\u2019m particularly fond of this period in history, and while I certainly don\u2019t know as much about the Scandinavian World as I think I should, I had briefly studied the Vinland Sagas as a student, in what I would say is one of the best modules I ever had the privilege of undertaking. This book brought this world to life.\nHistory can seem at times to be a bit cold and a bit distant, and the further back in time you go, the less evidence there is to help you reconstruct the past. The reason I enjoyed this book so much is because of the people. The political and religious turmoil certainly made the plot intriguing, but it is the characters, mainly Ranald, that makes the book so evocative. I\u2019m sure that there is more metaphorical meaning within the work than what I have interpreted for you here, and I\u2019m sure many of you would enjoy the book for those reasons.\nFor me I loved it because I didn\u2019t just escape into a book, I also got the chance to escape into a period of history that I adore.\nI remember picking up the copy of \u2018Vinland\u2019 in a lovely little bookshop in Stromness where Mackay Brown lived in Orkney. These days I\u2019m keen on having context and a bit of life woven into the tapestry of my experience with a book. While I am planning on going back, I don\u2019t think I can wait to go back to Orkney to get more books by him though; I think yearning for them badly enough to order them will have to be experience enough.",

    "context": "Last night, the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum at Claremont McKenna College hosted comedian Walter Kamau Bell to give a talk about ending racism. Prior to the event, Bell told the Claremont Independent, \u201cI absolutely have an agenda. It won\u2019t be hidden. And I\u2019m also married to a white woman with two mixed-race kids, so I\u2019m a bridge-builder.\u201d Additionally, Bell noted, \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me was that a friend of mine in Oakland\u2014white woman, lesbian, black kids\u2014just to say, this is a very specific type of person. In Oakland there\u2019s a lot of those. And we were talking about my racism show. And she said, \u2018Kamau, you can\u2019t end racism and make sexism worse.\u2019\u201d\nBell, introduced as a \u201cSocial Justice Ambassador,\u201d stated that he plans to end racism by instructing white people to form a tighter-knit community and to take pride in their race. \u201cWhite people, you have to have some pride,\u201d said Bell. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be reasons for white people to have good white pride. Right now, you\u2019re letting white people run rampant, and that makes the rest of us have to work harder. And that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d During his talk, Bell addressed the white audience members. \u201cWhite people, I can see your faces, the lights are on, the lights are shining. Say it loud, say, \u2018I\u2019m white and I\u2019m proud!\u2019 Here we go, white people. This is happening, this is a thing. \u2018I\u2019m white and I\u2019m proud!\u2019\u201d\nBell began his show by listing the words he was not going to use during the performance. \u201cWords like \u2018minority,\u2019 \u2018Caucasian,\u2019 \u2018colorblind,\u2019 \u2018people of color,\u2019 \u2018nonwhite.\u2019 Words like \u2018diversity,\u2019 words like \u2018multicultural,\u2019 \u2018multiculturalism,\u2019 \u2018multiculturalocity,\u2019\u201d [sic] the list began. \u201cWords like, \u2018Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019 And finally, the last word you won\u2019t hear in this show is \u2018the n-word.\u2019 Oh, don\u2019t be confused\u2014you\u2019ll definitely hear the word \u2018nigger\u2019\u2014you just won\u2019t hear \u2018the n-word.\u2019 In fact, \u2018NIGGER!\u2019\u201d he shouted, displaying the word in all caps on the projector. Bell did not use this word at any other time during the performance, but he did use the word \u201cdiversity\u201d despite his initial plans not to.\nBell later stated that he feels sorry for college students because \u201cYou\u2019re all on Twitter, you\u2019re all on Snapchat, you\u2019re all on Instagram, and so the world finds out what happens when you\u2019re in college and colleges can\u2019t be these little tight petri dishes anymore.\u201d Though Bell stated, \u201cI feel bad for you guys. I could\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes and you never heard about it,\u201d that didn\u2019t stop him from showing a Facebook photo of a group of current students\u2019 regrettable Halloween costumes and making fun of them in front of their peers. \u201cIt\u2019s America, it\u2019s your country. Enjoy your freedom. But there are consequences. That\u2019s how free speech works,\u201d Bell stated.\nBell, whose performance was\u2014as promised\u2014heavy on partisan content, also shared his opinions on Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re not voting for him. That\u2019s your boy, and you\u2019re connected through whiteness,\u201d Bell stated. \u201cIt\u2019s not about voting, it\u2019s about stopping the speech.\u201d Bell also criticized the staff of the Claremont Independent during his show. \u201cLatinos and black people get killed by police unarmed way more than white people. That\u2019s all facts. But you\u2019re like, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still not convinced\u2026 I write for the Independent.\u2019\u201d\nWhen the Independent asked Bell about free speech from a comedian\u2019s perspective\u2014specifically, comedians such as Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld citing political correctness as a reason not to perform on college campuses\u2014Bell stated that oversensitivity had nothing to do with the issue. \u201cThe story was that somebody told Chris Rock that they had stopped performing at colleges,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then Chris told Jerry Seinfeld, and Jerry Seinfeld told the media.\u201d Bell also noted, \u201cColleges are always more politically correct than real society because when you go to college you\u2019re supposed to learn new things. That\u2019s just how it works.\u201d\nBell said the reason he thinks these comedians don\u2019t perform at colleges is because colleges don\u2019t want them. \u201cAt some point you age out of performing at colleges. Colleges don\u2019t necessarily want to hear what a man in his sixties, like Jerry Seinfeld, or a man of Chris Rock\u2019s\u2014in his fifties\u2014thinks,\u201d the 44-year-old Bell stated. Additionally, Bell claimed, \u201cYou can\u2019t afford those guys because they\u2019re billionaires. Or millionaires, almost billionaires.\u201d\nChris Rock might disagree with Bell\u2019s analysis of the story. \u201cI stopped playing colleges, and the reason is because they\u2019re way too conservative,\u201d Rock stated just over a year ago. \u201cNot in their political views\u2014not like they\u2019re voting Republican\u2014but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody.\u201d Similarly, Jerry Seinfeld recently stated, \u201cI don\u2019t play colleges, but I hear a lot of people tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t go near colleges, they\u2019re so PC.\u2019\u201d Fortunately, Bell told the Independent that he is \u201ca big fan also of finding out that I\u2019m wrong about something and having people explain to me how I could be right about it.\u201d\n_______________________________\nPingback: scr888 download()\nPingback: iraqi colarts()\nPingback: In Vitro ADME Studies()\nPingback: inform\u00e1tica()\nPingback: cpns lapan 2018/2019()\nPingback: iraqi Seo()\nPingback: GVK Bioscinces()\nPingback: Best Engineer lawAws Alkhazraji()\nPingback: college of engineer()",

    "context": "Further to my post last Sunday about the transphobic ad by Paddy Power, and yesterday\u2019s overview by Jane Fae of the company\u2019s less-than-happy history of previous advertising campaigns, the following statement has today been issued by Clearcast, the NGO which pre-approves most British television advertising:.\nWhile this news is very welcome, the damage has been done and it remains to be seen if the withdrawal of the advert on its own is an adequate response to what may now be a potentially dangerous situation for any woman, trans* or cis, who attends the event. The advert has been screened, it\u2019s \u2018out there\u2019 now with all its faults; additionally, Paddy Power\u2019s response seems to come from a position of petulant unrepentance, as much as from unexamined cis privilege.\nAs I read it, the gist of the company\u2019s statement seems to be that the number of hits the video has received on YouTube is sufficient justification for its transphobia. Furthermore, its reliance on The Beaumont Society \u201cfor feedback on the script\u201d is puzzling. Personally, I\u2019m not at all convinced that it\u2019s the \u201cleading UK transgender group\u201d; I\u2019m not sure what that even means, let alone whether there is such a thing. I\u2019d like to know who suggested Beaumont, and why \u2013 and why Paddy Power didn\u2019t consult with any other group. At the very least, it seems to me that this whole fiasco could have been avoided altogether if Paddy Power had also entered into a dialogue with an organisation like Trans Media Watch. From my understanding, advising on this kind of media advertising campaign is well within their remit.\nAs for Paddy Power\u2019s closing question \u201cWere they right to ban us?\u201d I think this recentring of the issue around the hurt feelings of cis privileged people is disingenuous, to say the least and there\u2019s a far more pressing question in my mind. In the voiceover to the advert, Paddy Power state that:\n[\u2026] we\u2019re going to make Ladies Day even more exciting by sending in some beautiful transgendered ladies.\nI\u2019d like to know if the company still proposes to do that. Their statement today is silent on the matter but, to me, it\u2019s as much a cause for concern as the other issues. On the day (Wednesday 14th March 2012) will we see aggrieved punters roaming the course, looking for women who they think are transgender, to exact some kind of revenge for spoiling their fun (where \u2018fun\u2019 equates to their perceived liberty to consume adverts relying on transphobic tropes)? I really hope not. It would be appalling to see what\u2019s billed as \u201ca fabulous day out\u201d turn into a nightmare which adds to the already unacceptably high statistics of violence against women, trans* and cis.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTrans feminist fist symbol made by Helen from images found at Wikipedia (here and here).

The very idea of making something more \u201cexciting\u201d by \u201csending in some beautiful transgendered ladies\u201d is problematic, to my mind. The focus on \u2018excitement\u2019 and \u2018beauty\u2019 is clearly exoticising and othering trans women, and that\u2019s without the outdated language used. Both \u201ctransgendered\u201d and \u201cladies\u201d send up lil red flags to me. I wouldn\u2019t want to be a trans woman at that event. I desperately hope for their safety, if this goes ahead.",

    "context": "Sermon Summary: John 20:21-23\nWe all face the same choice that Adam first faced: Will you let God rule your life, live in the beautiful Garden-of-Eden of his blessing and have eternal life? Or, will you reject God\u2019s kingship, live in the wilderness apart from him and perish? The cross of Christ presents that choice most clearly. At the cross the full radiance of God\u2019s love was displayed and so were the true dimension of human wickedness \u2013 will you have Jesus, the King of Love, as your King? Or will you reject his love, depose him and sit yourself down in his place on the throne of your heart?\nIn these verses from John 20, when Jesus sends the disciples out he is sending the Church to fill every part of human existence with this same truth: With Christ as King there is life, beauty, goodness and truth, but without his Lordship there is nothing but emptiness and destruction. The Church\u2019s mission then \u2013 understood in the fullest sense (and pictured fully in Rev. 21) \u2013 is to order the whole of creation to this truth, condemning all evil and utilising every part of human ingenuity to order the world to the praise of God. The purpose of that mission is for the world to see that everything that is good, true or beautiful comes from the throne of Christ, while anything that rejects his rule ends up in destruction, misery and ruin. We call this the ministry of reconciliation because it reflects Jesus\u2019 own mission to reconcile all things to God through himself. (Col 1:20)\nThis understanding of the mission of the Church leads directly the idea of vocation. Vocation is the call that God makes to every Christian to fulfill some part of that big mission. Since God\u2019s plan is to fill every part of human experience with this truth, God gives each Christian unique gifts, (interests, skills, passions and spiritual gifts) and places each of us in different situations. Every Christian has a duty to use their gifts to condemn evil and order the world to the praise of God. As each person takes up their role, God\u2019s glory flows into the world in unique and powerful ways, presenting the truth of the cross ever more clearly, using every voice in creation to proclaim the Gospel to every tribe and tongue and nation. This call comes to all Christians, in every part of their life and at all stages of life.\nThis is a life-giving and freedom-imparting truth: It\u2019s true that the Christian life is meant to take effort, we are meant to strive at it, fighting evil and using our gifts to best of our ability, but God doesn\u2019t actually expect each of us to be good at everything, or for us all to conform to a one fixed idea of the perfect Christian life. Each of us has different gifts and callings, and that\u2019s not just \u201cOK\u201d, it\u2019s really beautiful! (Like a temple made of precious stones!) Since God builds us together into a temple for his Spirit, not only do we display God\u2019s glory more clearly, but we actually know him and enjoy him more as we fulfil our vocation.",

Pay no attention to your linguistically incompetent caller from England.\nThe United States of America is slowly becoming the stupidest population on the planet. Interference by people who want children to be as ignorant as possible, so they will become willing Christians. Desperate measures to support a religion that is fading away.\nDid you listen to the debate SGU had with McLeroy and read the followup talks Dr. Novella had with him after?\nIt\u2019s not so that they become willing Christians. That\u2019s a side effect.\nThe conservative base here in the US is fueled by anger, paranoia, racism, a sense of grievance, and punishment politics. They flock to fundamentalist evangelical Christianity because that is a simplistic, often vengeful, theology that they can understand, and, more importantly, can can reinforce their pre-existing prejudices.\nThe \u201cruling class\u201d of conservatism, however, pursues \u201ccheap labor conservatism\u201d. They are the gilded-age barons turned libertarians. All their policies (expensive for-profit education, expensive for-profit healthcare, restricted birth control, abortion services too expensive for the working class, no unions, no workers\u2019 rights, no labor laws, no safety standards, no environmental laws, no pollution laws, no regulation, no taxes, government bailouts while toughening citizen bankruptcy laws, lowering bailout loan interest rates while raising education loan interest rates, having business representatives write legislation, corporate interests backing the military-industrial complex into war\u2026 and all of that without pausing to think) have the primary or secondary effect of hurting the poor and middle class, while making businesses above the law. The wealthy will continue to be educated, while the poor will be functionally illiterate, desperate for health care (or food and shelter), and superstitious. They seek to turn the US into a land of sweatshops and call centers, just like Bangalore and Malaysia.\nPeople in these situations turn to religion because it is an institution that offers solace, support, education, and answers. This is well understood by the hucksters who manipulate the poor, uneducated, and afraid showing up at their churches for solace. It is a way to calm and control the masses, as well a fleece a little more money out of them.\nI watched it, I always do my homework. \ud83d\ude42\nI noticed how likeable Don the Dentist is.

    "context": "Must-Have Power\nAs David Johnson and Jeff VanVonderen state in their book The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse, leaders in an abusive religious system \u201cspend a lot of time focused on their own authority and reminding others of it, as well.\u201d[i] Those with true spiritual power walk their talk. Their life is their message. Cain\u2019s life is a lie, a sham, a charade. He must spend all his time telling you how great and powerful he is to cover up the farce.\nThe control issues in my cainistic church grew stronger and increasingly more destructive over the years. For example, before a person could teach classes in this church, it was mandatory that they complete a two year program to become a licensed instructor. One day Cain boldly announced to all the teachers that starting immediately it was mandatory that they attend every Sunday service, and if their attendance was not in agreement with his new ruling, he would revoke their privilege to teach classes at the church. Everyone must come underneath Cain.\nThat was the day my friend, Pam (name has been changed to protect her privacy), walked out. Although she had been a member and a licensed instructor for decades, she dropped out of the church never to return. She did not quibble or protest but prudently walked out of the mire of control and misuse. There would have been no advantage in talking to Cain about his decree because once he made a decision, there was no turning back. Furthermore, nobody questions Cain without paying for it, and he never forgets a dissenter. Even if Pam believed God called her to be a teacher, Cain determined the conditions of that calling. If the instructors taught classes at the church, then they must pay the price of listening to his sermons each and every Sunday.\nLikewise, the staff at the cainistic church was overworked and underpaid due to his autocratic leadership. He demanded long hours without complaints. Both burnout and turnover were vast. When fiscal deficit hit the roof, we learned that the staff had received one 3 percent raise in 5 years while the cainistic minister had received a 10 percent raise every year. The monies were unquestionably appropriated to the minister first, and the staff was considered if there was money left over. He also made sure he had a contract, not a salary\u2014all of which exposed his lack of empathy. There was no feeling for others, only for him.\nAs long as the church board did nothing to prevent this distortion and unfairness, he got away with it. There were nine board members that made business assessments and decisions with Cain. Where were they during all this staff abuse? Why did they blindly follow his dictates without daring to go against his decisions? In short, they complied to avoid being shamed. The shame Cain doled out was so vindictive and nasty at times, it was akin to an emotional crucifixion.\nWhile I was there, the cainistic minister harassed and lost six worship assistants in seven years. One of his dirty little control tricks was to ask where his assistant was during the middle of a Sunday service as if he suddenly needed her to check the thermostat or get him a bottle of water because his throat was dry and he was having trouble speaking.\nIf she was not in the sanctuary at that moment he called out her name, she caught hell later. I suspected he usually did that after he had already watched her leave the room. He was that devious. Destructive, malignant Cains find enjoyment in seeing others suffer. They are extremely mean-spirited and diabolical, always looking for a reason to lord their power over an Enabler and punish her. After one of the assistants quit, she quietly told me that nothing was ever good enough for him. No matter how hard she tried, he always criticized something about her.\nI watched him move from assistant to assistant, heaping spiteful mistreatment on his targets who had once believed in him like I had believed in him, but who turned into nothing more than his battered toys. He picked at their flaws and just before they smacked the proverbial wall, he withdrew the abuse, feigning that he didn\u2019t know what he had done to upset them. They must be supersensitive, he decided. He was always so blameless, so innocent of any wrongdoing.\nIf he did not know his crime, then he could not be held responsible for it, could he? Like the story of Cain and Abel, even when God tried to show Cain his mistakes by letting the straw smolder rather that burn, Cain refused to admit he made a mistake. Instead, he made one last attempt to deny everything. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d he retorted to God. Heaven forbid that he should stand up and accept responsibility for killing Abel.\nHundreds of demoralized staff, speechless board members, disgruntled congregation and attendees fled when they caught on to the hypocrisy. I asked administration and board members, who were incessantly talking about \u201cbuilding the numbers\u201d (which meant adding more members to the rolls) why they did not talk with the people who left to find out why they had left. It fell on deaf ears. When I left for almost a year, not one person ever contacted me to say they missed me or ask me why I had left the church. Cain knew why, and his administration and followers knew, too. As you might imagine, the numbers dwindled and the door was always swinging.\nVolunteers were treated with the same perfunctory manner. If the minister felt threatened by a volunteer, he would schedule a mandatory meetings at 9:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning when a volunteer, who was lovingly and willingly giving free time, might have personal activities scheduled or want to sleep in. I once retorted, \u201cYou\u2019d think we worked here the way they treat us.\u201d There are no such thing as personal boundaries when Cain abuses his authority; They are routinely ignored or trampled on.",

    "context": "\"Hay time\"\nResident of Upper Beeding and later Steyning.\nSome scarce, sepia-tinted real photographic cards of Beeding and the Downs at Poynings with white borders are marked \"Oldacre\" on the front. This is an unusual surname in Sussex, and, although no initials are given, it is reasonable to assume that the publisher was Everard Oldacre, who is listed as a private resident at Oak Cottage in Upper Beeding in Kelly's 1915 Sussex Directory. There is no mention of him in the 1911 and 1918 editions. The 1919 Electoral Register lists him as a voter (with his wife Mary) at a house called Bonnington at Steyning and at another house, Bramburye, close to the railway station at Bramber, but this time without Mary. The couple may have been in the process of moving house or perhaps Everard had acquired Bramburye as an investment. The Autumn 1920 Register lists them both at Glebe Cottage in Beeding. Within a few years they moved to a house called The Homestead in Upper Beeding.\nOldacre cards have uneven handwritten captions and a serial number. The highest seen is 15, which suggests that only a few cards were produced. Subjects include \"From Beeding Hill\", \"Haytime\" and \"Harvesting at Beeding\". A 1928 postmark is the earliest reported, and all the cards employ a style of preprinted back that became popular with Sussex publishers in 1927.\nA card of The Homestead viewed from the kitchen garden may have been produced for personal and family use. It is labelled R8 in contrast to other Oldacre cards, whose serial numbers lack a letter prefix.It too has a 1927 style back.\nOldacre was born on December 28, 1871 at Oakley in Croxall in the Tamworth area of Staffordshire. His father, Walter Oldacres, held a 230 acre farm (Broadfields) and employed 15 men and a boy. Walter had been born at Normanton Turville in Leicestershire in about 1833. Everard's mother was Helen Oldacres, n\u00e9e Norman, who had been born in about 1838 at Cosford in Warwickshire if the 1881 and 1891 censuses are to be believed, though the 1871 census says Leicestershire while the 1901 census plumps for Rugby in Warwickshire!\nWalter and Helen Oldacres had had five children before Everard was born, and employed a governess to look after them all. The oldest child was Gertrude Mary Oldacres, born in 1859. She was followed in 1861 by Arthur James Oldacres, then Albert Norman Oldacres in 1862, Maud Oldacres in about 1864 and Walter Lionel Oldacres in 1865. Walter Oldacres failed to register Everard's birth until the end of May 1872, which nowadays would have earned him a stiff reprimand and a fine.\nFor some unknown reason Walter Oldacres decided during the 1870s to shorten his surname to Oldacre and the rest of his family followed suit. By the time the 1881 census was held he had given up the farm, left Staffordshire and become an \"accountant's clerk\". He and his family lived in a house in Church Lane in Marple in Cheshire. Everard, who was still a schoolboy, is listed in the census as Edward E. Oldacre! His brother Albert was a railway clerk while Walter Lionel was an apprentice. In 1891 Everard and his parents were still living at Marple. His father is described in the census as a \"land agent\". Everard, who was a warehouse clerk, is listed as Ernest Oldacre. Maud, who had returned to live at home, was a schoolmistress. By 1901 Walter and Helen had retired to Southport in Lancashire, and Maud had moved to South Manchester, where she was a district nurse. Everard (now listed as Ernest E. Oldacre) lived with her and worked a cashier at a glass works. It seems likely that he was often called Ernest in preference to Everard.\nEverard (or Ernest) married Mary Connard at the Parish Church of Musbury between Accrington and Bury in Lancashire on July 8, 1902, when he was 30 years old. The marriage certificate records that he was a secretary, living at the Vicarage at nearby Helmshaw. Mary, who was a year older than Everard, was living in Southport and was the daughter of David Connard, a deceased decorator. His eldest sister, Gertrude Oldacre, attended the wedding.\nIn 1928 Sussex County Magazine published a photograph by Oldacre of Old Shoreham Bridge as a two-page spread.\nOldacre died on February 4, 1940 at his home, Little Coldharbour, at Spinney Lane roundabout at Pulborough, leaving effects of \u00a31305. He described himself in his will as a \"gentleman\", which suggests that he enjoyed private means. He was survived by his wife, Mary, who was granted probate in the name of Mary Oldacres.To directory of publishers\nDesign: Lucid Design\n\u00a9",

    "context": "Waste of community property may result in jointly owned community property not being divided evenly by an Arizona court upon a marital dissolution.\nSince Arizona is a community property state, property acquired during a marriage is generally deemed to be jointly owned by both parties and, upon divorce, is to be divided evenly. Exceptions do exist. In dividing marital assets and debts, courts can give consideration to excessive or abnormal expenditures by one spouse that amount to squandering jointly held property. The squandering of assets by a spouse, which is referred to as waste, may mean that the spouse committing waste will be allocated less property upon a divorce.\nIn an article published in the Journal of the Academy of Matrimonial Attorneys, the author observes that the following expenditures by one spouse, without the permission of the other spouse, have been found to constitute community waste: (1) gambling; (2) a failure to make mortgage or tax payments resulting in a foreclosure; (3) alcohol- and drug-related expenses; and (4) expenses incurred in furthering extramarital affairs.\nA good example of an Arizona case where waste was found is Gutierrez v. Gutierrez. There, the husband withdrew approximately $62,000 from the community retirement account without his wife's knowledge and was unable to explain how he had spent such a large sum of money. What was clear was that the expenditures were excessive, abnormal and did not benefit the community.\nThe Gazeley case\nThe recently decided case of Gazeley v. Larsen-Gazeley illustrates how the courts deal with claims of community waste. In Gazeley, a wife appealed from a marital dissolution decree and asserted that the trial court had improperly denied her claim for waste. The Arizona Court of Appeals emphasized that a spouse alleging community waste by the other spouse has the burden of showing evidence of waste after which the other spouse can present evidence in rebuttal.\nAt trial, the wife presented evidence in the form of a compilation of expenditures from a checking account, several credit cards and a PayPal account. The exhibit showed numerous transactions in a little less than two years totaling $92,559.04. The wife testified that the credit card charges were for places and restaurants she had never visited and for items she had never received. She suggested that, because her husband was having an affair during the time period in question, the monies were spent furthering the extramarital affair.\nThe husband denied community waste and testified that some of the expenditures in question were from taking clients to lunch, business travel, buying a present for his wife and his wife's Lasik surgery. He produced evidence that at least some of the charges were business expenses and that several of the checks in question were written to-and cashed by-his wife.\nThe court found no evidence of abnormal transactions. Further, the number of transactions did not, by itself, suggest that they were anything other than normal living expenditures. All in all, said the court, the wife's waste claims were highly speculative. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that the wife had failed to prove her claim of waste. Gazeley illustrates that, if a party charged with waste provides a reasonable explanation for expenditures, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in finding that no waste occurred.\nSeeking legal help\nIf you are contemplating a divorce and believe that your spouse has squandered community property assets, you should contact an Arizona attorney experienced at handling divorce cases. The attorney can review the evidence and counsel you as to whether you may have a viable claim for community waste.\nKeywords: community property, Arizona",

    "context": "Title Image: Clipart Library\nEtiquette is a changing part of our social norms. Despite their strange practice in some instances, most do have a very pragmatic historical origin.\nImage: Albion Swords\nShaking Hands\nAs most people are right handed, one\u2019s sword, which was carried at all times when travelling in mediaeval times, would be worn across the left hip for ease of access. Upon greeting another person, it became customary to extend one\u2019s right hand in demonstration that it was bearing no weapon. Thus the handshake developed as a sign of greeting and peace.\nThe handshake has developed in many parts of the world and it is wise before visiting another country to check the social protocols.\nIn Japan and China, for example, a weaker handshake is preferred. (Yuck!)\nIn India and many Asian countries, the respectful Namaste gesture, sometimes combined with a slight bow, is traditionally used in place of handshakes. However, handshakes are preferred in business and other formal settings.\nImage: Universal Peace Foundation\nHandshakes are also used in other situations. Romany Gypsies, for example, will conduct a negotiation through an on-going handshake during which messages are signalled through various movements of the hand and wrist.\nBowing\nBowing in Western countries tends to be reserved as an act of deference and respect for members of Royal Families and their representatives, certain Judicial and Government figures and religious purposes. It is also practised in Martial Arts and other forms of combat.\nImage: Wikipedia\nIn the East, bowing takes on a whole new level of significance. Every country and every culture seems to have its own protocols around bowing from the simple lowering of the head through to laying prostrate on the floor with arms spread wide in a show of complete surrender and subservience.\nAgain, it is wise to learn up on the social etiquette of a country which includes such pleasantries as part of their cultural behaviours.\nImage: Wordnik\nCurtsying\nThe curtsy (derived from the word \u201ccourtesy\u201d) is the female version of a bow.\nAccording to Desmond Morris, the famous anthropologist, the motions involved in the curtsy and the bow were similar until the 17th century, and the gender differentiation between the actions developed afterwards. This is more than likely due to the fashion of longer dresses.\nStrictly speaking, a curtsy involves the pli\u00e9 movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight. Both feet and knees point out so the torso lowers straight down, as the head is bowed. It is staggering how few people can do a decent curtsy!\nEastern countries tend not to use curtseying, preferring the Namaste style of action as their sign of deference. There are some variations so please check before travelling!\nIn the Middle East it can become extremely complex for ladies to know what is expected as it changes not just from country to country but between ethnicities also. There have been some famous incidents! Women receive a very low level of respect from many peoples of the Islamic world.\nThe different salutes, Prince Harry in the Army and Prince William in the Navy. Images: Daily Mail\nSaluting\nIt was customary, for an armoured soldier, for his helmet to be removed for the sake of identification upon being greeted.\nThis military tradition continued into the times of Busbys or Bearskins as worn by Guardsmen. As this headgear is extremely heavy and large and includes a chinstrap, the tradition morphed into a touching of the headgear in a show of deference to a senior officer. This gesture was then formalised into what we know today as the salute.\nThe Army of the UK salutes with the back of the hand flat against the forehead and index finger just above the eyebrow. The Navy salutes with the palm pointing downwards. This is because Queen Victoria did not like to see the grease smeared hands of her sailors as they saluted her!\nAnglo Saxon Drinking Horn Image: britishmuseum.org\nClinking of Glasses as a Toast\nIn days of yore, there was much mistrust between the various Peers of the various realms around the world. The attempts to undermine a family were commonplace.\nThe poisoning of a rival\u2019s drink was a practice which became almost a fashion. To disprove such a ruse, the two principals in such a situation would clash drinking vessels, whether a pewter goblet or a bull\u2019s horn, causing the drink from each vessel to spill over into the other. The host would then drink first and demonstrate the safety of the guest.\nThis practice continues today as a symbol of wishing good health to others.\nGood Health to you and Namaste!\nAll Rights Reserved. \u00a9Edward Bryans 2017.

    "context": "Not all blogs are real.\nThat is, they don\u2019t cover real events happening to real people in the real world. They are actual blogs. They\u2019re just fictional. They cover the events in lives of fictional characters in imaginary worlds that can (but often don\u2019t) resemble the real world.\nSince today, June 15, 2013, is Free Role Play Game Day, we thought we\u2019d take a closer look at fictional blogging (disclaimer, the author maintains multiple fiction/character blogs and has written the ebook on TBRP).\nThere are two types of fiction blogs. The first and probably the most common type, belongs to a specific character. The second type follows a particular story or plot. Both a character or a story line blog can have a single author or be a collection of works from a variety of authors. In some cases, each character might have a sub-blog with the master, top level, blog being the collected stories of all the characters (this is a great way to write a novel for NaNoWriMo, by the way).\nMany fictional blog posts are based on writing prompts and their format reflects that. Typically such posts stem from a prompt table of some kind, although this isn\u2019t always true. Some just use the format which consists of some basic \u201cfront matter\u201d including:\n- Title\n- Author (if the blog has multiple contributors or follows more than one character, otherwise the author is assumed to be the character who\u2019s blog it is posted on)\n- Prompt (if a prompt table or other source of inspiration like music or tarot cards is being used)\n- Word Count\n- Characters (characters depicted/involved in the post, directly or indirectly)\n- Summary (a summary of the post, what storyline it belongs to, setting or time period, where it falls in character\u2019s timeline, etc.)\n- Warnings/Announcements (NSFW, adult themes and which ones, contains spoilers, etc.)\n- Disclaimers (if the author does not own the rights to the characters or universe, who does?)\nOnce that business is taken care of, a fictional post is very similar to an excerpt from a novel or a short story. Some are parts of a larger work while others, sometimes referred to as one-offs, stand alone on their own. Some authors include photos or other images with their posts or may provide additional information to help readers understand the context of the post.\nFictional blogs can be some of the most creative and extensive blogs you\u2019ll ever see. They can also be very bare bones and text-heavy. It depends on the blogger and the platform.\nTumblr hosts a number of fictional character blogs. The nature of Tumblr means these blogs are highly visual (lots of images) and the entries are relatively short and quick to read. Tumblr blogs can also include tweets, music and video which allows readers to get a more complete and complex sense of the characters. Some of our favorite Tumblogs are:\n- Tales of Murhder \u2013 An Alternate Universe (AU) blog based on the characters from the Black Dagger Brotherhood novel series.\n- Bubblegum Vamp \u2013 An Original Character (OC) blog set in an alternate True Blood universe.\n- The Werewolf Within \u2013 An AU blog based on the character from the Southern Vampire Mysteries.\n- Love Cannot Die \u2013 Some of the best paranormal steampunk fiction around.\nIf Tumblr offers a better sense of character because of it\u2019s social network flavor, WordPress boasts some truly remarkable and complex fiction that often reads like a novel or even a series of novels. Among the truly remarkable fiction you\u2019ll find on WordPress.com are:\n- Musings of a Madman \u2013 Is a frighteningly fascinating alternate Hannibal universe that is home to some intriguing original characters.\n- Diaries of a Dead Girl \u2013 An AU blog based on the True Blood/Southern Vampire Mysteries universe.\n- Remaije \u2013 A Neverwinter blog\n- The Haunted World of Shades \u2013 Some hauntingly good ghost stories!\nIt\u2019s worth noting that none of these are my characters or blogs although my characters have made appearances or been reblogged on some them. Also, you\u2019ve no doubt noticed the True Blood/Southern Vampire Mysteries trend. This is because that is the fanfiction world I am most familiar with. If you\u2019re really curious, you can find fiction that has flowed from my pen at: Reflections of the Night on WordPress as well as several places around Tumblr like Pam\u2019s Place and Dark Attitude, which are all Southern Vampire Mystery blogs. (I do blog other original fiction, however, I\u2019m hoping to turn them into books/novels so I\u2019m not going public with them.)\nThe practice of fiction blogging is not too different from nonfiction blogging. The art of it is a different matter.\nIf you are interested in learning more about role play/fictional blogging on Tumblr or WordPress, please follow my RolePlayWriter blogs.\n6 thoughts on \u201cFictional Blogging\u201d\nReblogged this on Never Pity The Past.\nIt\u2019s genuinely very complex in this full of activity life to listen news\non TV, so I only use web for that purpose, and take the most up-to-date information.\nHello my family member!

The LRC offers a variety of programs and services, some of which can be accessed by all members of the community and others that are available only via qualification or psychometric evaluation.\nServices and Fees\nBasic Services\nFees for enrollment in the LRC for the 2017\u20132018 academic year are as follows:\n- Elementary School: CHF 750\n- Middle School: CHF 1,000\n- High School: CHF 1,500\nThese fees help support the costs of delivering Basic Services, which include the following:\n- formulation of a Learning Support Plan (LSP) describing your child\u2019s cognitive strengths and weaknesses and detailing the accommodations he or she is entitled to on the basis of his or her learning difference*\n- yearly LSP meeting with parents, teachers, and the student\n- \u201cpush-in\u201d services and formal bi-yearly feedback to parents\n- consultations with LRC staff on an as-needed basis\n- provision of extended time on internal tests and exams\n- applications to external testing agencies for accommodations on external exams (e.g., PSAT, SAT, ACT, AP, and IB)\n* The type of classroom accommodations varies by diagnosis and age of the student. In all cases, however, the goal of providing accommodations is to remove obstacles to performance so that the student has equal opportunity to learn and to demonstrate his or her competence.\nAdditional Services for Students\nFor students requiring remediation, the LRC will organize and deliver specialized \u201cpull-out\u201d instruction in specific academic areas (e.g., reading, writing, math) during the course of the school day. These services are only available to students in the Elementary or Middle School, as High School students requiring remediation are referred to the TASIS Tutoring Program and pay for services accordingly. Pull-out remediation for groups with 3\u20134 students are subject to the following price structure:\n- CHF 3,375 for three 45-minute sessions per week\n- CHF 4,500 for four 45-minute sessions per week\n- CHF 5,625 for five 45-minute sessions per week\nPull-out sessions that involve 1\u20132 students per group are subject to the following price structure:\n- CHF 4.320 for three 45-minute sessions per week\n- CHF 5,760 for four 45-minute sessions per week\n- CHF 7,200 for five 45-minute sessions per week\nPlease note that despite the best efforts of children, parents, and teachers, interventions and accommodations sometimes are not sufficient for a student to succeed academically. In those instances, an appropriate conclusion is a misfit between the child and the School program and the response to such situations is to find a school more suited to the child\u2019s educational needs.\nOrganizational/Study Skills Tutorial\nBeginning in September 2016, the LRC began offering an Organizational/Study Skills (OSS) Tutorial. In addition to students diagnosed with ADHD, many students with specific learning differences (dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia) also experience difficulties with executive function skills. Executive functions include a variety of skills important for academic success, including regulating attention and emotions, selecting and initiating relevant task goals, planning and organization, shifting problem solving strategies, self-monitoring, sustaining concentration, and working memory. LRC staff will be providing a semester-by-semester OSS Tutorial for students in the MS and HS who are enrolled in the LRC. The sessions will be held twice weekly, and lessons will be interwoven with students\u2019 actual homework assignments, projects, and tests. General themes will include planning and organization, time management, prioritizing and organizing homework assignments, note-taking skills, memorization strategies, test preparation, and emotion regulation. Similar to the \u201cpull-out\u201d remediation, the OSS Tutorial will be delivered by a learning specialist in a 4:1 student to teacher format. In the MS, it may be possible to offer the OSS Tutorial during the study hall period, but the diversity of the HS schedule would necessitate an after-school program. Fees for the OSS Tutorial will be CHF 1,200 for each semester. Parents may choose to enroll their child in the fall semester, spring semester, or both.\nServices to the Community\nOperating as a community resource, the LRC works to provide a variety of programs and initiatives to improve the educational experience and learning opportunities for all. Some of these services are available free of charge whereas others involve fees for service. Examples of community services include the following:\n- workshops in learning strategies, stress management interventions, and parent education groups\n- consultations with faculty and parents regarding pathways to student success\n- professional development training for faculty and staff\nAdmission Requirements\nStudents with diagnosed learning differences are admitted to TASIS based on the following criteria:\n- average or above average intellectual ability (as measured by standardized IQ tests)\n- excellent motivation, a positive attitude, and a good work ethic\n- committed to participating fully in the life of the School\n- seeks and would benefit from a college preparatory program\n- committed to learning or perfecting English language skills (whether native or non-native speakers)\n- committed to being a good citizen, in sympathy with the program\nAs TASIS does not have a full range of learning support services, admission of a student with learning differences is contingent upon a match between the level of service available and the needs of the student and family based on multiple sources of information. A student\u2019s acceptance and continued placement at TASIS is dependent upon full disclosure during the admissions process. Failure to fully disclose information regarding a student\u2019s learning differences may jeopardize his or her current and future placement at TASIS.\nThe policy of the Learning Resource Center requires that a student has received a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation within the past three years from an appropriate psychometric evaluator (e.g., clinical, neuropsychological, and/or educational psychologist). If the testing and report are not in English, the family will need to have it translated prior to submitting the report to TASIS. The evaluation must include the following:\n- standardized IQ test with reported standard scores and percentile ranks (e.g., WISC, WAIS, Stanford-Binet)\n- standardized achievement test with reported standard scores and percentile ranks (e.g., WIAT, Woodcock Johnson)\n- other standardized tests related to the referral question (e.g., reading, short-term memory, attention, emotional functioning)\n- diagnosis by a recognized diagnostic system (e.g., DSM-V or ICD-10)\n- comparison of a student\u2019s performance on timed and untimed tests if the student is seeking extended time as an accommodation\n- list of recommended accommodations based on the results of the evaluation",
    "question": "What are the admission requirements for students with learning differences at TASIS?",
    "answer": "Students with diagnosed learning differences are admitted to TASIS based on the following criteria: average or above average intellectual ability (as measured by standardized IQ tests), excellent motivation, a positive attitude, and a good work ethic, commitment to participating fully in the life of the School, seeking and benefiting from a college preparatory program, commitment to learning or perfecting English language skills (whether native or non-native speakers), and commitment to being a good citizen, in sympathy with the program. Additionally, the admission of a student with learning differences is contingent upon a match between the level of service available and the needs of the student and family based on multiple sources of information.

But I am of sound mind. Labeling me a paranoid is a usual ploy. If this concept is such a surprising first time for you, maybe you might want to take time to study the \"paranoid\" concept. Certainly, the documents show just how freaked out Ben Gurian was, and the adamant May, 1963 Kennedy letter to him resulted in Ben Gurian resigning as prime minister. JFK was the cause for that. With LBJ installed the entire tenor turned 180 degrees regarding inspecting Dimona. The many documents indicate France provided much of the technology for the Ustaeli test. At the same time Israel was involved with China's efforts at obtaining the bomb. China tested a bomb in 1964 I believe. That bomb was said to have been an Israeli test in which the Chinese participated. But the official Israeli test was in 78 or 79. I don't make this up. Documents back up the assertions. The mob was not Italian controlled. The top leadership was Jewish. Las Vegas was their headquarter.

    "context": "There is a new \u201cold\u201d outbreak in America which for lack of a better term can be described as \u201cworkplace intimidation\u201d and can also be called organizational bullying. One of the best online websites devoted to the problem is workplaceintimidation.com which has many resources and tips for how to respond to work day abuse and abusers. The site offers consulting services as well as information and is the brain child of Judith Munson. Judith calls work place bullying the \u201csilent epidemic.\u201d\nSpeaking as a disabled person I must say I\u2019ve experienced lots of inappropriate behavior in the work place as \u201cthe disabled\u201d are generally imagined to be workers of sufferance\u2014that is, so the thinking does, we\u2019re lucky to have a job and we should therefore shut up about our needs for accommodations or, gadzooks, our wish to be respected. Talk to people with disabilities who work (we\u2019re about 30% of the disability population, on a good day) and you\u2019ll hear stories of maltreatment that will curl your hair. One of the best books to tackle the subject is Ruth O\u2019Brien\u2019s groundbreaking volume Voices from the Edge which pairs trenchant legal analysis alongside first person stories of disability employment discrimination. (Disclosure: I have a short story in the book.)\nWhat interests me is that discriminatory practices within management, which have always been directed at child laborers, women, people of color, and those few lucky disabled who actually land a job, are now widening out, becoming a tacit style, a matter that encourages thoughts of social contagion. Judith Munson explains this may have something to do with the recession of 2008 and writes:\nFinancial experts claim that the current recession and slow recovery has been extremely stressful on employers and managers. This might be to blame for the upturn in people using intimidation to get better performance and more productivity from their employees.\nA lot of people these days are being overrun by more and more responsibilities where they work and they might not realize that they are actually using intimidating behavior on other co workers.Unfortunately, the people that use intimidation and bullying tactics in the workplace usually get away with the abuse. They will usually receive good periodic evaluations from their superiors and end up climbing the corporate ladder ahead of others.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better description of the neoliberal workplace than this. From universities to manufacturing plants, from financial services companies to auto repair shops, contemporary employment centers on demanding fewer people do more and more. Because this is only nominally possible in most cases intimidation is the incentivizing dynamic of choice. Bonuses are out. Teamwork is severely limited. Transparency has gone down the drain. As the folk singer Greg Brown once sang: \u201cYou\u2019re at pink slip\u2019s mercy in a paper universe\u2026\u201d\nIn other words you\u2019re lucky to have a job at all. Don\u2019t talk back. Which leads me to my point: neolib work environments have successfully transformed able-bodied employees into disabled ones.Of course not literally but still, consider what\u2019s generally being seen and reported across a wide landscape. Being asked to do more with less is eerily similar to being asked to do a job without the accommodations one needs. If the employee asks for help, she\u2019s tagged as incapable. In disability circles we know all about this. It\u2019s a very old story.\nBut the similarity doesn\u2019t stop there. If you work differently, have a unique style, have opinions of any kind that are not in step, then you\u2019re uppity. (This figurative re-wrapping of employees happens nowadays at dizzying speed. One minute Gladys was respected for her candor, the next, she\u2019s a malcontent.) Moreover once personnel, whether they\u2019re college faculty or accountants are told that their righteous indignation at being overworked or ignored is a character flaw, then bullying is OK\u2014don\u2019t \u201cdifficult\u201d people need to be put in their place?\nIn order for this management charade to be widely accepted people must broadly fear for their jobs. Fear in the work force is what they used to call in the insurance business \u201cthe incitement premium\u201d\u2014you\u2019ll buy anything if you\u2019re properly scared.\nBullies must have buddies to rule the playground. Me? I\u2019m not buying. But I can say what I think. I have tenure. At least today.",

It diverges too far from what I would like Python to be. (Are you reading, Guido?) I can take advantage of what you describe in Perl, but Python's precision is part of the romance. . There would be ambiguity, which would require a lot more work on the compiler's part, and a lot more thought on the programmer's part to remember all the rules.

    "context": "I\u2019ve held off commenting on the Pope and the Catholic child molestation story only because it was more interesting to watch the rest of the world spin in a tizzy of concern and outrage while still completely missing the point. It\u2019s truly fascinating to watch most everyone from pundit and commentator to politician and parishioner wonder if the Pope should take any responsibility for the crimes of his church or the acts protected and promoted on his watch as bishop.\nIndeed, some rightly point out that the institutional molestation and rape of thousands of children worldwide should be prosecuted and that everyone within the church who protected the criminals who committed these atrocities should be held accountable as accomplices to the crimes. Obviously. Oh if only the Catholic church would recognize the authority of US justice system and hand over the supporting documents in full cooperation with court subpoenas.\nBut most of the media somehow continues to miss the elephant with the long robes and funny hat right in front of them pissing in the the holy water.\nSo I ask anyone in the media who might come across this humble blog, in light of these horrible acts inflicted against the most defenseless among us, why do we give preferential treatment to any organization purely because they make unprovable claims of divine sanction?\nIf any other corporation or organization in the US had promoted and protected systematic child rape the police would not have hesitated to raid them in an effort to shut them down as soon as possible, to seize evidence for trials, to jail everyone involved, and to secure assets to be distributed to the victims.\nOf course the Vatican is no mere corporation but is in fact a sovereign entity recognized by international law. It is reasonable however to expect that the United states would levy severe sanctions and even attack and invade any foreign nation operating bases in the US where the systematic rape of US children is being committed. The assertion that those bases are recruiting new members and distributing unverifiable propaganda would of course be a completely irrelevant and absurd defense.\nSo to put it more succinctly, this Pope and the Catholic church are directly responsible for the molestation and rape of more US children than Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Hitler combined. Why haven\u2019t people and the media been demanding that the police and the US government take stronger actions against this criminal organization that has for decades been committing crimes against humanity and protecting those who committed them?\nAnyone?\nLook at Bill Donohue and his mentality. Until he dies and until all the other assholes with mindsets just like his die too, nothing will change. Sadly the world is filled with Bill Donohues.\nLast I checked neither Bill Donohue nor the Pope were in control of the police and Department of Justice\u2026well at least not officially anyhow.\nYeah, it\u2019s frustrating. I suspect a lot of cops and judges have the disease known as Catholicism. The Catholic influence is very pervasive\u2026kind of like herpes.\nAs if one needed more evidence, here is a video with more evidence that this Pope not only knew about the abuse but actively delayed acting on the information.\nHitchens said something along these lines recently. I think I remember you saying you don\u2019t care for him but as far as brains go, good company to be in.\nImpeach the mutherfucking Pope.\nOutside of Iraq I do agree with Hitchens\u2026but he\u2019s still annoying. I could be in far worse company to be sure. \ud83d\ude42\nWhat I seriously don\u2019t understand is that people simply aren\u2019t leaving the church in droves. Why are parents setting their own children up to be potentially molested? What the hell is wrong with these people? I wouldn\u2019t allow my child to be part of an organization that has been proven over and over again to protect pedophiles at all costs. There is a certain level of insanity that exists in people who would choose to put their children within harms way.\nYou make an excellent point with this blog. No other organization would ever get away with the systematic abuse that exists within the Catholic church. It\u2019s insane.\nI agree with you but I also don\u2019t understand why anyone (with kids or otherwise) would want to remain affiliated with such a criminal organization? The Catholics are starting to deserve the same level of respect as members of the Westboro Baptist Church (even though those inbreds are on a full Michele Bachmann dose of batshit crazy).\nShit, even members of the Klan have the decency to be embarrassed enough to leave their robes at home and not generally brag to the population about their affiliation.\nRichard Dawkins planning to have Pope Benedict arrested over \u2018crimes against humanity\u2019\nThis is ultra interesting. \ud83d\ude00\nWow, I didn\u2019t know about that one. I guess the only way I disagree with Dawkins and Hitchens is to suggest that they aren\u2019t going far enough by only arresting the Pope\u2026but I must agree it is a good start.\nSince the pope (small pp\u2019s in pope) is the head of a criminal organization, why is everyone so surprised that he won\u2019t do the right thing or tell truth on this matter. Since 100% of the time he is spreading nonsense based on lies and fairytales, why does everyone expect him to fess up and own up to his responsibilities on this matter. He is after all just remaining true to his nature of being 100% full of shit all of the time. That\u2019s like asking a pick pocket to hold your wallet for a minute while you count your change\u2026oh, damn\u2026you mean he just took my wallet? Why couldn\u2019t he just hold it for me\u2026I was just going to be a minute. Did you really expect the truth from the pope? Who\u2019s the fool?\nMy point exactly. Let\u2019s get a team of Seals together to secure the Vatican and let the lawyers in to pour over the files and gather evidence.\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. Great post \u2013 I\u2019m really enjoying the blog, SJ.\nI\u2019m glad you like it. Stop by anytime.\nYours looks interesting as well. I\u2019ll be back. \ud83d\ude42\nAlong the same lines as crazyliberal\u2019s post, Kevin Annett is doing something similar in Canada for the country\u2019s + church\u2019s crimes against indigenous people:.

    "context": "Writers are particularly observing, analytical, and creative when it comes to their approach to perfecting their craft. But for some reason they seem to be at a loss when it comes to their understanding of why their writing career hasn\u2019t soared. The truth is they need to embrace the kind of common sense advice that they likely would dole out to others. If only they can observe themselves from a distance and then sharpen their tools to repair their writing lives.\nHere are 14 areas all writers should focus on \u2013 if they are serious about becoming successful authors and book marketers:\n1. Learning more about book publicity and marketing. Whether you read blogs like this one or read books, attend conferences, download instructional videos, subscribe to industry magazines, listen to helpful podcasts or consult with other writers, build up a body of working knowledge in the very area that will help you grow the most.\n2. Utilize strong time management skills to help you balance your commitments and desires. You\u2019ll need time for writing and for promoting. Time for strategizing, researching and learning, and time for taking action. You\u2019ll need time for work, chores, rest, family, friends, health, fun and everything else life demands from us. Budgeting your time, setting priorities, staying committed and focused, and acting out of a sense of urgency are a must.\n3. Raising funds or borrowing resources will be the key to your writing freedom. It takes money to make money, so have a plan on how to pay for marketing campaigns. You may need funds to give you time off from work so you can have time to write and market your book. Who or what will be your bank?\n4. Networking will always be helpful in life, but especially for your writing career. It is true that who you know is more important than what you know. Those who have access to the things and people that could help you are worth a lot. They help you take shortcuts and eliminate lost time and failed efforts. Get to know the kind of people who can help you, from other writers to publishers, editors, literary agents, members of the media, writer groups, and trade associations.\n5. Be organized. It may seem like obvious advice \u2013 and it\u2019s applicable to every career \u2013 but I can\u2019t highlight its importance enough. You need to have your act together in order to be a really successful writer. You can have a messy desk, work under chaotic circumstances, and deal with many challengers, but you do need to be organized and self-disciplined.\n6. Choose to write and promote -- not either or. One must invest a heart and soul to write well and often. The same is true for book marketing. Leave energy, time, and brain power every day to do both.\n7. Find support. Writers are loners and we pride ourselves as being independent thinkers, even leaders. But we need help too \u2013 whether from a professional coach, mentor, friend, colleague, family, or therapist.\n8. Set goals or set yourself up for failure. Create a plan to address all of the smaller steps to meeting specific goals. Set priorities and deadlines for yourself. Fitter all activity through the prism of fulfilling your goals. Anything else puts you off track and on the road to nowhere.\n9. Participate in social media. Yes, don\u2019t cringe. Set up your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube \u2013 or all of them -- and post, share, connect, and click until you see your members go up, up, up. No matter how many books you sell from it, social media is important.\n10. Always further your branding and marketing. It\u2019s a 24-7 experience. You need to work at in order to get good at it \u2013 and to get a pay-off. If you need assistance, hire a marketer or branding expert.\n11. Get better at procuring and doing news media. There\u2019s so much media out there \u2013 local and national \u2013 even international. There\u2019s radio, television, newspapers, magazines, newsletters, trade publications, blogs, podcasts, video sites, and so much more. Become an expert by declaring yourself one via media appearances, byline articles, book reviews, and guest posts. Again, hire a publicist to help fill in the gaps or to simply take over the process for you.\n12. Speak and then speak some more. Every opportunity to speak can lead to book sales, book deals for a new book, more speaking opportunities, media exposure, a chance to influence others, and a great time to build your marketing portfolio.\n13. Develop spin-off products, services, and books. Also, sell off or pursue other rights formats (such as audiobooks, e-books, paperback editions, foreign rights, film and TV, etc. Will you create a series? Can you repackage content into something else like a paid webinar or seminar?\n14. Acquire technology devices/programs and the skills to use them to your advantage. This is a battle everyone in the 21st century must take up. We need to be aware of the myriad of devices out there that can help us be more efficient and successful. Plan on taking refresher courses, online tutorials, or experimenting in order to find the right technology that becomes an asset to you and not a burden.\nThis list could have been of 114 things \u2013 not just 14 \u2013 that writers should address in order to advance their careers. But these 14 shall serve as a great starting point, and if mastered, will really position writers to become profitable and successful artists.\nIn Praise of Books\u201cThe books we read help to shape who we are. Reading offers us, as children, our first independence- allowing us to travel far beyond the confines of our immediate world. Books introduce us to great figures in history, narratives that stir our spirit, fictions that tug us out of ourselves and into the lives of a thousand others, and visions of every era through which human beings have lived. And in the process of stretching who we are, books also connect us to all others- of our own or previous times- who have read what we've read. In the community of readers, we instantly become linked to those who share our love for specific characters or passages.\u201d --\nThank you for this article it gave me insight of what to expect on my journey to becoming a published author.

Unlike Rifles, enemies can't protect their friends using Shields, making the Rocket Launcher ideal for taking out groups of enemies at long range.\nHowever, despite these massive advantages, Rocket Launchers have equally massive disadvantages. They hurt allies and enemies, which means you will likely not be using Rocket Launchers in combat, and ironically more from a stealth standpoint. They also only have 2 ammo max, so unless you have ways to boost maximum ammo or refill ammo in combat, your Rocket Launcher usage may be short-lived.\nRocket Launchers are also loud, which draws enemies to the source of the noise, though this can be considered an advantage or a disadvantage.\nRocket Launcher Weapon Type:\n\u00a92008-2017 Dragoon Entertainment Ltd.",

Sorry about that folks. I am hoping to get Ciarrai Studios ready for an August 20th grand opening but that means that I have been in a frenzy of photographing pieces, writing up descriptions and keywords, pricing, and occasionally getting to do the fun part of designing a new piece or two. (For the record, it won\u2019t be too hard to maintain once the store is open and I am adding a couple of pieces at a time but I have 50+ items that I need to write up and describe and it is a bit of a daunting task).\nI have been so insanely busy that I really haven\u2019t had time to knit or read or do anything other than work on the store. Hopefully, I will get a handle on everything soon and can stop being so single-minded, especially since the fall semester is starting soon and I really will need to focus on my classes once they begin.\nI would have some really cool pieces to show off today if only the rest of the beading supplies I ordered would arrive. *glares at my empty mailbox*\nI have this incredible earthy, boho-chic piece in the works that was inspired by a Maya Angelou poem but while I have the pendant and gemstone in hand, I am still waiting for all the findings (clasp, jump rings, crimp bead covers, etc) and the antiqued copper and brass that will contrast beautifully with the gemstone to arrive. I called the company and they say that it will most likely arrive sometime next week. It\u2019s killing me to wait because I am really excited about this piece!\nI also have some new resin pendants in the works but I ran out of resin and I am waiting for the resin that I ordered to arrive. Once it does, I will have these incredibly cute sushi-themed pendants, complete with little silver chopsticks. I am also working on a Secret Garden-themed necklace that I am really excited about and some coffee-themed pieces (even though I, personally, am a tea drinker). I found the cutest little coffee bean charms and some Swarovski crystal, in a color that is appropriately named \u201cMocha\u201d and I think the combination will be adorable.\nBut since I can\u2019t finish any of these pieces until I receive my supplies and because it has to be done, I am going to go back to doing the not-so-glamorous but oh-so-necessary administrative and marketing work that I need to do in order to open the store.

Rowe\nIn his overview, Dr. Rowe provides a preview of the essays contained in this specially-themed issue of Daedalus. He introduces the considerations and strategies that are relevant to a comprehensive understanding of the institutional and policy changes required for the United States to emerge from the demographic transformation with a resilient, productive, equitable cohesive, secure, and sustainable society. He urges policymakers to consider both the benefits and risks to an aging society. He suggests the development of a unifying strategy that optimizes the balance between the two while emphasizing that older individuals have tremendous capability to productively participate in the workforce or through volunteerism.\nThe Demographic Transformation of America\nS. Jay Olshansky\nDr. Olshansky examines the future composition and function of the United States population. He explains how, within the next 30 years, the population will experience a permanent change in its age structure. He addresses why life expectancy in the United States is likely to diverge from that experienced by the rest of the developed world; describes recent trends in healthy-life expectancy; and examines how the age structure of the U.S. by mid-century will be different from that found today.\nHispanic Older Adult Health & Longevity in the United States: Current Patterns & Concerns for the Future\nRobert A. Hummer & Mark D. Hayward\nThe Hispanic population aged 65 and over\u2013the most socioeconomically disadvantaged subset of America\u2019s elderly\u2013is projected to quintuple between 2012 and 2050. Essay authors provide an overview of current longevity and health patterns for this older Hispanic population. Specifically, they focus on four key issues impacting Hispanics\u2013undocumented immigrant status, health insurance coverage, trends in important health behaviors, and continued socioeconomic status disadvantages. They conclude their discussion by urging forward-thinking policies aimed at enhancing the health and longevity profile for this aging population.\nThe Future of Intergenerational Relations in Aging Societies\nFrank F. Furstenberg, Caroline Sten Hartnett, Martin Kohli & Julie M. Zissimopoulos\nAs the pressure mounts to reduce the public costs of supporting rapidly aging societies, responsibility for supporting elderly people will increasingly fall on their family members. Essay authors explore the family\u2019s capacity to respond to these growing challenges. In particular, they examine how family change and growing inequality pose special problems in developed nations, especially the United States. They conclude by considering some possible dilemmas that policymakers may face in their efforts to support families.\nLabor-Force Participation, Policies & Practices in an Aging America: Adaptation Essential for a Healthy & Resilient Population\nLisa F. Berkman, Axel Boersch-Supan & Mauricio Avendano\nPopulation aging in the United States poses challenges to societal institutions while simultaneously creating opportunities to build a more resilient, successful, and cohesive society. In their essay, authors argue that expectations about old age have not sufficiently adapted to the reality of aging today and that institutions need more adaptation in order to successfully face the consequences of demographic change. They describe some of the underemphasized benefits that working and remaining active may have for health and well-being in older populations and suggest that it is not demographic transitions that will shape our future, but instead how our institutions and policies respond and adapt to them.\nProductivity & Engagement in an Aging America: The Role of Volunteerism\nDawn C. Carr, Linda P. Fried & John W. Rowe\nVolunteering in late life is associated with health benefits such as reduced risk of hypertension, improved self-related health and well-being, delayed physical disability, enhanced cognition, and lower mortality. In their essay, authors examine volunteerism, those who are volunteering and how they and the institutions and people they serve are affected. They propose that the impact of volunteering in an aging population be recognized and invested in, and that effective programs harness social capital of older adults to address critical societal needs and also improve the well-being of older adults. They further suggest that elder volunteerism presents a significant opportunity for health promotion and deserves consideration as a national public health priority.\nResetting Social Security\nS. Jay Olshansky, Dana P. Goldman & John W. Rowe\nIn this essay, authors examine the case for and implications of resetting the eligibility age for early and full Social Security retirement benefits. They present evidence demonstrating that the rate of improvement in life extension at older ages accelerated after 1983 by exploring four central questions:\nHow well did the two-year increase in eligibility age for full retirement benefits from the 1983 amendments correspond to the proportional rise in life expectancy at age 65 from 1935 to 1983?;\nFrom a demographic perspective, does the rise in life expectancy at older ages observed since 1983 warrant a further adjustment to the age of eligibility for early and full Social Security benefits?;\nHow would subgroups of the population with different survival prospects be differentially influenced by further increases in the age of early and full retirement ages? ; and what would the early and full retirement ages be today if they had been indexed directly to rising life expectancy since the program\u2019s inception?\nGlobal Population Aging: Facts, Challenges, Solutions & Perspectives\nDavid E. Bloom, David Canning & Alyssa Lubet\nThe rapid aging of populations around the world presents an unprecedented set of challenges: shifting disease burden, increased expenditure on health and long-term care, labor force shortages, dissaving, and potential problems with old-age income security. While longer healthy life spans are an enormous gain for human welfare, essay authors suggest that current institutional and social arrangements are unsuited for aging populations and shifting demographics; and propose that the best solution is to change our institutions and social arrangements.\nIndividual & Social Strategies to Mitigate the Risks & Expand Opportunities of an Aging America\nJulie M. Zissimopoulos, Dana P. Goldman, S. Jay Olshansky, John Rother & John W. Rowe\nWhile increasing life expectancy offers the potential benefit of additional years of productivity and engagement for individuals and society, it also carries substantial risks. Authors of this essay detail the risks associated with aging at the individual level including longevity, frailty, and financial insecurity and at the societal level including lack of cohesion, inequity, and lack of productivity. They present policy recommendations to mitigate these risks.",

    "context": "Much of Lebanon's four million people may be wondering if Mr Ahmadinejad is arriving as a friend or a conqueror.\nBeirut sets scene for Ahmadinejad\nBEIRUT // When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrives in Beirut for his first state visit to Lebanon, many of the hundreds of thousands of people expected to line the streets in welcome also will be thanking the Iranian president for the steadfast support he and his government have shown the Shiite militant group Hizbollah.\nThe problem is that only about one-third of Lebanese are Shiite and maybe half of them support Hizbollah. That leaves much of the rest of the country's four million people wondering if Mr Ahmadinejad is arriving as a friend or a conqueror, considering the group's near total military and political supremacy in this nation. Fadia Kiwan, the head of the political science department at Beirut's Saint Joseph University, told the local YaLiban website the Iranian president's intent and political deftness remains the question.\n\"At stake is whether Ahmadinejad is coming to show support for Lebanon or whether he plans to use Lebanese territory as a springboard for his own interests,\" she said \"The Lebanese, and Hizbollah in particular, must fully take advantage of Iran's support but must also realise the limits of this support, that it's a double-edged sword.\" Iran has spent much of the past five years using its proxies in Hizbollah to politically, and occasionally physically, battle with Lebanon's Sunni population. The Sunnis primarily look to the United States and Saudi Arabia for support. Their conflict has often mimicked the regional power struggle between the Sunni and Shiite states for influence in the region.\nAnd with many Lebanese deeply uncomfortable with Hizbollah's increasing power and influence, not to mention its aggressive pursuit of goals that seem to go beyond its mandate to protect the country's borders from Israel. And adding to the ambivalence felt by many about the visit is that Hizbollah finds itself in a bitter fight with the government of the prime minister, Saad Hariri, a Sunni. They are at odds over the investigation into the 2005 car-bomb assassination of Mr Hariri's father, Rafik, a former Lebanese prime minister, being carried out by the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon. There is a widespread belief that at least some members of Hizbollah will be indicted for the slaying.\nWith rhetoric by both sides recently reaching an alarming level, given Lebanon's long history of sectarian violence, the feuding has been temporarily set aside for the Iranian's president's visit. While some supporters of Mr Hariri have questioned the timing of the visit by a benefactor of Hizbollah, famed for making inflammatory statements in public forums, the Lebanese government - Mr Hariri included - has gone through great pains to characterise this one as a normal state visit.\nMr Ahmadinejad is slated to conduct the usual round of visits with the president, Michel Suleiman, Mr Hariri and the Shiite speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri. Still, he is also expected to pay tribute to the accomplishments of Hizbollah at a huge rally tomorrow evening in the heart of its stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs. The fete might include rare public appearance by the group's charismatic leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.\nThe pictures of the Iranian president surrounded by crowds of adoring supporters will probably be unsettling to Mr Nasrallah's political enemies, even if the rhetoric remains directed at Israel and not his domestic rivals. But Mr Ahmadinejad's expected visits on Thursday to south Lebanon - to key sites of Hizbollah's fight against Israel and Iran's financial support for the fight - will be made not with militant leaders, but with Mr Suleiman, another sign that all sides hope to escape this week without a major political incident.",
    "question": "What is the concern of many Lebanese people regarding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's first state visit to Lebanon?",
    "answer": "Many Lebanese people are concerned whether Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is arriving as a friend or a conqueror, considering the Shiite militant group Hizbollah's near total military and political supremacy in the nation. They are unsure if Ahmadinejad is coming to show support for Lebanon or if he plans to use Lebanese territory as a springboard for his own interests.",

Lebanon\u2019s \u201ckidnapped\u201d U.S. ally tweets he\u2019s okay, but still in Saudi Arabia\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\u201cIn this matter, there is complete agreement between us and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which was never one of our enemies nor have they fought us nor have we fought them, and I think there is a complete consensus between us and them in regards to the Iranian axis,\u201d Eisenkot told London-based pan-Arab newspaper Elaph.\n\u201cI was at the meeting of the chiefs of staff in Washington, and when I heard what the Saudi representative said, I found it was exactly identical to what I think about Iran and the need to confront it in the region and the need to stop its expansionist programs,\u201d Eisenkot added.\nSaudi Arabia has refused to recognize Israel since its establishment in 1948 and the mass expulsion of Palestinians that came with it. After the Islamic Revolution toppled the pro-West Shah in 1979 and established Iran as an anti-imperialist force in the region, however, Saudi Arabia and Israel\u2019s interests began to align.\nBoth countries were vicious critics of former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (and have been proponents of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to scrap it), and both opposed Iranian support for foreign political and militant movements across the region. Iran was crucial in creating and supporting the powerful Lebanese Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, which twice forced Israel into a stalemate in Lebanon,. Saudi Arabia and its allies also accuse Iran of funding groups in Yemen, where the Saudi kingdom is involved in a prolonged war against the Zaidi Shiite Muslim group known as the Houthi movement, and in majority-Shiite Muslim Bahrain, where the pro-Saudi Sunni Muslim royal family blamed a recent oil explosion and fire on Iran-backed militants.\nTo help Saudi Arabia thwart its increasingly powerful rival, Eisenkot made the unprecedented move of offering to cooperate directly with Saudi Arabia\u2019s intelligence.\n\u201cWe are ready to share information if necessary. There are many common interests between us and them,\u201d Eisenkot said.\nThe interview, which was published in Saudi media as well, was particularly explosive due to recent events between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a citizen and supporter of Saudi Arabia, stunned the region when he announced his resignation after a secret trip to Riyadh. Hariri, whose father was killed in a 2005 bombing his supporters blamed on Hezbollah and its Iranian and Syrian allies, claimed he fled a similar plot, leading Saudi Arabia to state it considered the supposed conspiracy an act of war.\nHezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, Lebanese President Michel Aoun and others, however, have argued Hariri\u2019s decision to step down was compelled by Saudi Arabia and that the Sunni Muslim politician was subsequently detained. Hariri claimed Tuesday and Wednesday he was \u201cperfectly fine\u201d and hoped to return to Lebanon soon, but his rivals feared the move could be a pretext for Israel to launch a new war against Lebanon in hopes of routing Hezbollah.\nA representative of Hezbollah\u2019s media office told Newsweek last week that the group didn\u2019t expect an imminent war with Saudi Arabia, but condemned its interference in Lebanese affairs. Nasrallah, who accused Saudi Arabia of declaring war, urged Israel on Friday not to exploit the Lebanese crisis to stage an attack, but said he thought such a move would be unlikely. Eisenkot said Tuesday that Israel had \u201cno intention of initiating an attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon and starting a war, but we will not accept there being any strategic threat to Israel.\u201d\n\u201cOur demand is that Hezbollah leave Syria and that Iran and its militias withdraw from Syria. We have calmly said both publicly and secretly that we will not accept any Iranian position in Syria, and especially their concentration west of the Damascus-Suwayda road. We will not allow any Iranian presence, we warned them against building factories or military bases, and we will not allow that,\u201d Eisenkot said.\nEisenkot dispelled rumors of Israeli collusion with Al-Qaeda\u2019s Nusra Front, now called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which maintained a presence near the Israel-occupied Golan Heights, in southwestern Syria. Israel has offered medical assistance to various Syrian rebel groups opposed to Assad, according to The Times of Israel, and it has reportedly paid the salaries of some as well, but it maintains no official position on the outcome of the war in Syria. It has, however, clashed with ISIS and conducted airstrikes against the Syrian army, Hezbollah and other Iranian assets in the neighboring country.\nWith the Israeli and Saudi positions converging, reports of quiet agreements between the two have increasingly surfaced. Last month, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Abdul Aziz Al Saud made a secret diplomatic visit to Israel, according to Agence France-Presse. The 32-year-old royal has become an increasingly influential force in the monarchy and, hours after Hariri announced his resignation, led a sweeping anti-corruption purge that saw dozens of Saudi princes, officials and ministers arrested.",

    "context": "Being Satisfied in Jesus when He Doesn\u2019t Feel Satisfying, Worshipping Emotionalism v. Worshipping Jesus\nOne of my favorite authors, Larry Crabb, wrote an article several years ago that I read on a consistent basis. One of the reasons that I read it so often is because I need to continually be reminded of the truth it contains. Namely, that following Jesus may or may not be accompanied with feelings of satisfaction or fullness at all times.\nOne of my biggest concerns, particularly for college students in 21st century America, is that the cravings for emotionalism and felt-satisfaction trump genuine worship of Jesus and obedience to Him.\nWe (Christians), particularly young Christians, have made an idol out of how we feel. Far too often we have an obsession with emotionalism, not with Jesus.\nIs Jesus satisfying? Yes. Does He always feel satisfying? Not always. Is following Jesus going to always be accompanied with a great sense of felt satisfaction in Him? Sometimes, yes\u2026but sometimes, no.\nIn other words, if we only obey and glorify Christ when we feel near to Him, then the reality is that there will be seasons in our life when we won\u2019t obey and glorify Him very often; because our emotions and what we feel are inconsistent at best.\nOn that note, here are 4 dangers to consider in wrestling with this issue\u2026\n1) The danger of letting felt pleasure motivate our obedience and worship\u2026\nIf felt pleasure is our motivation for obedience, then sin will often be irresistible. Crabb says it like this:\n.\u201d\nSo then, what should motivate our obedience/worship of God?\nOur minds/what we know to be true regardless of what we feel: (see Romans 12:1-2, Philippians 4:8, Colossians 3:2)\n2) The danger of satisfaction-centered worship rather than Christ-centered worship\u2026\nIs Jesus the object of your worship? Or is how you feel when you worship Jesus the object of your worship? Again, Crabb says it like this:\n\u201cIf we live for an experience of joy, if we elevate desire to central status and live for nothing higher than its felt satisfaction, then we no longer are living by faith. We are idolaters worshipping desire. We are no longer living for God.\u201d\nWhich one of these statements do you resonate with as being most true of your worship experience?\n- Feeling satisfied is the point of my worship and my obedience is designed to bring me pleasure.\n- God is the point of my worship and my obedience is designed to bring Him pleasure.\n3) The danger of living for satisfaction NOW.\nWe will certainly have many times in our Christian journey when we will feel satisfied in Christ, but our satisfaction in following Jesus won\u2019t fully come until heaven (See 2 Corinthians 4:16-5:10). On this topic, Crabb says this:\n\u201cBut that fullness of joy comes later, in heaven. In this life, it\u2019s more about hope than about joy\u2026.\u201d\n4) The danger of living by feelings rather than by faith.\n.\u201d\nFor more on this topic, go to this link and read under the section \u201cDo not Depend on Feelings\u201d\nLastly, it\u2019s important to clarify that our emotions and affections for Christ are important. In no way am I, or Larry Crabb, suggesting that the Christian life be an emotionless endeavor. The problem arises when we long for an emotional experience/felt satisfaction more than we long for Jesus Himself. Jonathan Edwards rightly concluded that true worship is when the affections of our heart and the intellect of our minds collide to worship God. Both are important! But let\u2019s be faithful to not elevate one over the other, but rather let\u2019s elevate Jesus and let Him direct our emotions as He desires.\n**If you would like a copy of the entire article by Larry Crabb, email us at alabamacru@gmail.com\nPingback: Being Satisfied in Jesus when He Doesn\u2019t Feel Satisfying, Worshipping Emotionalism v.

WT, June 1, 1985, Article: 'Subjecting Ourselves to Jehovah by Dedication'\nIf the organization is 'spirit-directed' by Jehovah, why does it disagree with what Jesus said in Matthew 28:18-20?\nIf I get baptized into the Jehovah's Witness faith by saying 'yes' to their baptismal vows, I will be rejecting the instructions of Jesus in Matthew 28:18-20. Am I willing to do this?\nAm I willing to rebel against the authority of Jesus in Matthew 28:18,19? Jesus said that all authority was given unto him in Matthew 28:18-20.\nThe organization knows what the Bible says. In 1955 and 1966, they told us the truth. They said that Christians do not dedicate their lives to any organization or religion. Why did they leave the truth and run ahead of Jesus? 2 John 1:9\nAll Christians have a direct personal relationship with God symbolized by baptism. Christians can attend any church. They are free. Why? Because they do not dedicate their lives to any organization or religion. They dedicate their lives only to God.\nThat's the difference between Christian baptism and baptism as a Jehovah's Witness. Christians answer directly to God. Christians are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. According to Jesus, no organization or religious affilliation is required for salvation. Luke 10:25-28\nIn Christian religions, all Christians partake of the bread and wine that represents the body of Christ. In the JW religion, only a few thousand participate because they are the only ones who are in a covenant with God! Millions of other Witnesses can not participate in the bread and wine. Instead they must be obedient and loyal to the 'annointed' Governing Body because the GB claims to be God's exclusive channel of communication and everyone must go through them in order to receive eternal life. For references and Watchtower quotes on this important matter, see Mediator\nWill I follow Jesus and be baptized as a Christian? Or will I follow an organization and be baptized as a Jehovah's Witness? We cannot serve two masters. The Bible says that Jesus is the path to eternal life. John 3:36; 1 John 5:11; Jude 1:21",

I checked his diaper, held him and fed him.Still, the lower\nlip trembled and he looked at as though I was his jailer and torturer.\nHorror and betrayal clouded his eyes as they begged the question: \"What have\nyou done with my mother?\" On more difficult days, he cried himself to\nsleep--only a short-term relief from which he'd usually awaken with the\nunknown cause of distress still intact.\nHow a Tree Grew Out of a Burning Bush\nby Jennifer Hudson\nI remember clearly the summer of 1997, a tumultuous period in my\nspiritual life marked by an accentuating sense of dejection, emptiness, and\nisolation. I felt so lost, so depleted of positive energy, and so desperate,\nthat I ventured to my local bookstore hoping to find a burning bush that\nwould lead me to the promised land.

    "context": "The statement if youth knew and age could refers to the possibility of what things could be if the young knew the truths of life and were wise and if the old could be more strong and do what is required even in old age. The statement seems to suggest that such things are only utopic dreams and not actually possible, since the youth lack wisdom and the old lack physical strength. In the new age however this seems very much possible. First, the youth of today is far more wisened and second, the old far more young.\nThere was a time when at 40 one felt like a really old man with grandchildren and failing health, a time more appropriate for the recommended 'vanaprastha' as per old hindu customs. It was time to let your son be the head of the joint family and take over the reigns of the physically strenuous duties of maintaining the household. Even though one did not go out into the jungle, one simply relaxed and used his wisdom to guide the new head of the family. Those were ofcourse times when a lot of physical labour was required to achieve anything. People traveled on foot, did not have the comforts of modern day living, could not do business right from the home via the phone or internet, etc.\nNow science and medicine have advanced enough to make life absolutely sedentary and easy on the physique. Longevity and vigour have dramatically improved. At forty, one manages to marry and only slightly settle into some kind of life. Children are still school going and in no way ready to take over the reigns. In fact the saying 'life starts at forty' seems more appropriate and retirement isn't even an option. Yes government servants do have a retirement age, but that is a forced decision rather than an optional one or a necessary one. Things like retirement ages fixed by governments are very much dependant on political and other social factors like availability of jobs etc. And people continue in similar fields or do something new even after retirement. Even in sports people no longer retire. They may not play any more, but they either start coaching or doing commentaries or open sports institutes. Nowadays, the youth wings of various parties have leaders the age of forty, a clear signal towards what is called youth today.\nOn the other hand, is the youth of today, very mature and responsible. The exposure that they go through and the pressure to excel in this very competitive age has made them more mature than they were ever. Of course in early ages the youth of today were considered adults and had to take the responsibilities of the whole family and was already a parent in his teens. The definition of youth has changed since, and now means people in their twenties and early thirties. The 20th century defined the youth as those, that had to educate themselves on emerging streams of knowledge and were exonerated from demanding jobs and responsibilities. But this padding did not last in the 21st century when younger and younger people started taking charge of situations and the traditionally old sectors like management were taken over by the youth. The media coupled with other forces have lead the children of today to be more informed, more aggressive and more willing to take over responsibilities. Earlier there were limited fields where young people achieved, one being sports, but now we see young people achieving everywhere. We even have many young people as Union Ministers. Earlier it was said, only years of long practice made you perfect enough in any field specially in the fine arts, but now we have newer and younger artists taking over in a more pressurizing environment and doing very well. One of the reasons for this success could well be due to a large and ever growing segment of young consumers who know their minds. A new kind of maturity seems have taken over the youth of today. In fact children too seem to be very much mature and learn to fend for themselves in these pressure driven times.\nThe above statement also implies that young people are more energetic and over enthusiastic and the old more balanced and patient but at the same time, may lack the drive to change things. The youth in their enthusiasm overlook some finer details and jeopardize the journey; and the old, being overcautious, miss the bus. It further implies that if only the youth knew more balance and the old, more adventure, great things could be achieved. And this is the balance that our own government has tried to achieve through the civil services, which puts young Turk's at the head of departments full of older and experienced people who can constantly guide them and ring the warning bells; while the young ones with their fresh insights and enthusiasm can give shape to a new India.\nHaving seen that an aged person now is not a man of 40 but more suitably of 60, and a young man is not only a man in his 20's but well may be nearer 40, there has occurred an overlapping of the young and the old. This obviously means an admixture of the old and the young. This potent mixture has all the capabilities of fulfilling mankind's dreams, and we are surely headed towards the right direction. There is, however, still talk of things like generation gap, but this gap is not only between the old and the young. Longevity has given rise now to the gap between the very young, the mature and the old, and the idea is very well portrayed by the veteran filmmaker Mr. Raj Kapoor, in his film 'Kal Aaj Aur Kal'. A greater openness and the overlapping of youth and old has lead to a greater understanding of things. We are surely heading towards a balance of mind in the young and a feeling of adventure in the old, and therefore it's no longer 'if we could', but 'we shall'. We know and we can.\nBy\nJagdeep Singh More, Mumbai",

I have worked with different international and local artists. My technique is semi-abstract, na\u00efve, mixed media, and acrylic on canvas.\nEejo.co.rw: Tell us why why did you decide to follow painting not joining other profession like engineering, medicine, law, journalism and others?\nOlivier: Actually, I got talented since my childhood, I used to draw and attending many competitions in primary schools; then after closing my secondary school, I didn\u2019t get any opportunity to go to University and I decided to join URUMURI ARTS (it was a group of two artists who have already done art at school, Nyundo ) as an amateur. As well as I didn\u2019t have much money, I tried to pay Urumuri arts for almost six months and they helped me to develop my skills on drawing and after I started to use acrylic colors. I have chosen to do art, not for getting money or that I has got a talent, but also to express myself through art. In my artworks, I used to paint a daily life, which I got its inspiration from my own situation, I have my siblings whom I am taking care of them.\nEejo.co.rw: Now you are a professional painter ; where do you usually acquire the inspirations to make a brilliant and constructive painting deed?\nOlivier: To say the truth, I often get unalike inspiration through our everyday life people and environment.\nEejo.co.rw: To the high extent of your sophistication what kind of positive impacts art might have on people\u2019s lives?\nOlivier: Art is a form of expression. Art is important especially when it comes to expressing inner feelings, thought and so many other things. Art can also be a therapy to heal people \u2018wounds from every kind of sufferings.\nEejo.co.rw: If I am not fallacious you belong in youth category, how do you think art can improve the life of young people?\nOlivier: Teaching art in schools, Organizing art festivals, inviting a large community in exhibitions, not only the target people and Street art/ murals: awareness on HIV, importance of education\u2026are some of the way art can improve youth people\u2019s lives. Art also can affect young people\u2019s development as their mindset: being open, creative and innovative. Many people are get infected with HIV are mostly youth, so using murals (Awareness about HIV, Importance of education\u2026), workshops, Exhibitions(development, working together\u2026) can help youth.\nEejo.co.rw : what is your hallucination or what you are forecasting to do in the future?\nOlivier: I wish to meet the greatest artists, being more creative and to make a change in my art pieces, I mean to develop my art style. I wish also to prove my knowledge on art, exhibit beyond and outside East Africa and Africa, have my own gallery in future and Teach and spread the importance of art. I expect to be recognized through publicity, advertisement, and shows\n( Radio, TVs, Newspapers,\u2026)\nEejo.co.rw: Finally, what is your general memo to the young people like you who need to yield money out of their talents?\nOlivier: I call upon the young people to try to discover their talents since they are still young, and to look forward to getting from their future. For me, there is a\nquote that I like \u201cLife is not about finding yourself, life is only about creating\nyourself\u201d. From that, I got a lesson that no one will help you to see what\u2019s inside of you, only you, you will discover it, and don\u2019t hesitate to go or ask somebody someone else for a help.\nClaude Uwihoreye.",

The capris I've lived in all summer long are going to look really silly in January, and it will *be* January before I know it.\nI ordered some Vogue patterns while they were on sale at the Vogue website and they arrived today. One of them is #2913, Sandra Betzina pants. I just looked to see if there were any reviews for it on Pattern Review and these results are mixed. Two nay and one yay. But ... one of the nays is definitely not my body type and the other has called herself a beginning sewer and there's no photo so it's hard for me to guess my results based on hers. (If you're that reviewer and reading this, in no way do I mean that as an insult. Just that I'm unsure whether it was fitting skills or the pattern or ? that led to your results. I hope that came out right. I do still appreciate the review and your time for writing it.) The only yay seems to be my body type but there's no photo.\nAlso in today's mail were the Christine Jonson patterns I ordered from a coop (and yes, some fabric was in the box too), which included another pair of pants ... these:\nThere are also three reviews for these pants. Again two with photos, and the one closest to my body type without. But, all three of these reviews were positive.\nSo readers, which one would you pick??\nSigh. I guess it's time for the tape measure and another muslin dance.\nDebbie, I would choose the CJ pattern. But then again I am lazy and they look like they have less details. Have fun!\nDebbie, if you are thinking about using the stretch bengaline fabric then the CJ pattern would be my choice, from the two you selected.\nHi Debbie, I'm that reviewer, no offense taken. I cannot edit my profile over at PR for some reason. I'm more acomplished than a true beginner, but not advanced by any means.\nThe pants were huge, and the leg shape is off. I do really like the waist treatment, although I left that great large overlap off.\nI did your beautiful fisheye dart and because of that, the only successful part of these pants was the seat. That fit really nicely.\nNo photo, but I could not get a decent one of bad black pants. To get an idea of my \"size\", I measure between an E and an F, with the F being the waist. I cut the smaller size and tokk a couple of inches in all around, even at the waist.\nIf I were to make them again, I'd redraft the legs, the inseam tapers much too sharply.\nI won't sew them again, but I do very much like that contour waist.\nAt this point, I'm pretty much doing style modifications on my Joyce Murphy JSM Pant1 pattern.\nGood luck with the decision, and if it were me, I'd try the CJ pattern.\nDebbie, I would also use the CJ, but then I'm a sucker for CJ patterns. Can you share the co-op address where you purchased your pattern?\nSounds as if the SB pattern has major \"vanity sizing\" problems, but if you know, you can choose a smaller size. The CJ pattern certainly sounds easier... I think I'd try that first, unless you really want the contour waist. How's that for fence-sitting!\nAnn,\nThanks for not taking offense and for your helpful add'l info. I may be venturing off in another direction after some discussion with Belinda about the fabric.\nDebbie,\nI decided to make the SB Vogue pattern (in spite of the warnings on PR) because the C measurements should have fit me perfectly thru the waist and hips -- and it was a Sandra Betzina pattern. They were so huge I threw them in the garbage.\nMary\nHave you flat measured this yet? I just did, and the others are right - it is big.

    "context": "This week, I'll be teaching in Springfield, Ohio for the Remembrance Quilt Guild. It's a Set-In Piecing Simplified workshop using a scrappy tumbling blocks quilt as the project. As I was packing my workshop samples, I got to thinking about how much easier making a spontaneous, scrappy quilt is for me since teaching the spontaneity and value workshops based on Gai Perry's classic book, Color From the Heart.\nEarlier this year, Joanne over at Everyone Deserves a Quilt asked how I organize that exercise and this is what I shared with her. I'm sharing it with you today because I think it would be a good warm up for your fall quilt making activities. Invite a few quilting friends, a minimum of 5 to 6 people is best -- more is fine, to join you. Here's how I set it up.\nEveryone cuts 4\" squares into triangles -- usually two squares each from 50 fabrics so there are 200 triangles. When the group gets together, everyone trades 50 triangles -- easiest, fastest way to do that is to count out 5 stacks of 10 triangles then trade each stack with a different person.\nThe amount of time for the session determines whether or not the group does any sewing.\nFor a half-day session, there is no sewing. After the trading, put all the triangles into a brown paper bag. Have a piece of flannel or cotton batting set up for a \"work wall\". Pull two triangles out of the bag, decide which is the darker of the two and then position them on the flannel depending on the overall layout being used.\nFor an all-day session, after the trading is done everyone sits down with their bags, pulls out two triangles out of the bag lottery style and stitches them together -- no cheating -- chain piecing should get most quilters through this step in a hour to an hour and a half.\nPress the seams towards the darker triangle. Then back into the bags they go again. Now begin to draw out the HST's, one at a time, and place them onto the \"work wall\" in the correct position for the design. Expect to whine a lot at this point but just keep pushing through!!\nEveryone starts at the upper left corner and works across the top row until there are 10 HST's in place. Then begin the second row at the left end and just keep going until the piece is 10 across by 10 down. Once everything is laid up on the work wall, it's best to take a break.\nAfter about 5 minutes, participants should then come back to their work and they can make minor adjustments. First though it's important to identify what they like about the spontaneous layout. An important part of the exercise is to experience the spontaneity and see that when you are working with fabric you enjoy, it works well. An example of a minor adjustments might be something like there are only 5 aqua triangles in the entire piece and they are all clustered in the same area -- then it's good to scatter them around so they don't draw the eye to that area but rather serve as a \"bit of sparkle\" here and there.\nIt's helpful to the group to make part of the exercise walking around and looking at each participants work wall, talking about each piece, identifying things that work, and paying attention to how they feel about each other's pieces. Doing this quadruples the effectiveness of the exercise.\nIt's easy to overwork these pieces by switching so much around that the piece loses it's spontaneity and becomes too controlled to be interesting. The unexpected is what makes a quilt interesting!! The two fabrics in each HST don't have to be coordinated or match -- the light vs. dark positioning carries the design.\nThere are lots of options for the overall layout. Usually I have everyone do the same simple arrangement but it might be fun to have several arrangements and randomly assign different ones to each participant? I've never tried that.\nThis is the last one I did. They are fun to make and the final border really brings them to life.\nAnd they make cheerful charity quilts as well.\nMy charity group just had some books donated to us to sell off to raise money for our batting. There is a copy of Color From the Heart available if you are interested!! $10 plus shipping -- just leave me a comment!!\nHope your week is off to a good start!!\nMary Huey\n'\nWhat a fun exercise and a great way to learn about value. This would be a fun activity for a Guild bee day!\nColor From the Heart class (Austinburg...a gazillion years ago) was my favorite class ever!",

My training village in Madagascar is something like 40 miles away from the capital and our village doesn\u2019t have phone lines or Internet access.\nThere are 26 trainees\u2014eight males, eighteen females\u2014in my training group, and they are all my soul mates or heterosexual life partners. Nearly everyone has traveled abroad at some point, and they are really interesting and fun people. It\u2019s incredible how similar we are and how much fun we have together. Plus, it\u2019s comforting to speak with people who are doing exactly what I\u2019m doing and have thought and felt exactly what I\u2019ve been thinking and feeling. We all have aspirations and anxieties about doing the Peace Corps in Madagascar, and these commonalities downplay my worries and make me more optimistic for success.\nAfter I last left you, I met two trainees who were headed to Burkina Faso and four other trainees who are in my group. We had dinner and chatted over beers at an Irish pub. The next day we had registration and a four hour orientation session where we talked about the Peace Corps\u2019 history, its role in the world, and how it was different from other international volunteer efforts. What\u2019s nice is that unlike many non-governmental or non-profit organizations, the Peace Corps doesn\u2019t throw money at a country and expect success; it instead operates at a micro-level where volunteers bring progress and sustainability to countries community by community. And instead of being driven by drivers and living in compounds with other foreign volunteers, Peace Corps volunteers are immersed in the country\u2019s culture so we can be gentle American ambassadors and also bring the country\u2019s culture back to Americans. (By writing this blog, I\u2019m contributing to one of the Peace Corps\u2019 objectives of cross-cultural education.)\nYesterday, Sunday, we took anti-malaria pills for the first time. Most of us were issued mefloquine, a once-a-week malaria prophylactic that apparently has the nasty side effect of giving us very vivid nightmares. Over dinner at a Thai restaurant with other trainees, I joked that that night we would dream of riding elephants into a phone booth, and on the other end of the booth\u2019s long hallway we would meet Richard Gere wearing a fanny pack and saying, \u201cHere is your Malagasy host family,\u201d and from his fanny pack would produce our host parents and host siblings. For better or for worse, I did not have such a dream last night. I\u2019ll keep you updated on the vivid nightmares.\nThe Peace Corps gave us debit cards loaded with $180 for meals, transportation, and anything else we needed while in Philadelphia. Since the Peace Corps is a U.S. government agency, our debit cards were hilariously and obnoxiously patriotic: They had an American flag covered in text from the U.S. Constitution and a huge \u201cWe the People.\u201d I was surprised that it didn\u2019t feature President George Washington with a hand over his heart looking stoically into the distance. We\u2019ve been living extremely comfortably on this money\u2014it\u2019s more than enough for the three days that we\u2019re here for orientation.\nI just got out of today\u2019s eight hour orientation session where we learned about cultural adaptation and immersion, Peace Corps policies, health and safety, and our schedule for the next few days. There were many ice breakers, skits, and group exercises throughout. At the end of the orientation, our speaker, a former Peace Corps volunteer who served in Costa Rica 1983-1985, teared up as he wished us well for our next two years abroad. Some trainees teared up, too. The twelve hours of orientation heightened our anticipation for our adventure. A female trainee told me, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been drinking the punch. When I call my parents and they ask me if I\u2019ve changed my mind about the Peace Corps, I\u2019ll just laugh.\u201d\nWe\u2019re taking a bus to New York tomorrow and leaving in the evening for Johannesburg, South Africa. We\u2019re spending a night there, but the Peace Corps is advising us to stay in our hotel rooms since the city is apparently really dangerous. The next night we\u2019re flying to Antananarivo, Madagascar and spending a night there. On Friday, we go to our training village and meet the host families with whom we\u2019ll be living for our ten weeks of training.

    "context": ", 1994\nGWENDOLYN CUFF\nv.\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINE CO.\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by: THOMAS N. O'NEILL, JR.\nMEMORANDUM\nO'Neill, J.\nI. Introduction\nPlaintiff Gwendolyn Cuff alleges that she was discharged by defendant International Business Machine Company (\"IBM\") for the purpose of depriving her of IBM employee benefits in violation of section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140.\nA bench trial was held. This Memorandum constitutes my findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 52(a). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that plaintiff has not shown that defendant terminated plaintiff's employment in order to deprive her of employee benefits in violation of section 510 of ERISA. Accordingly, I will enter judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiff.\nII. Findings of Fact\nA. Background\n1. Defendant IBM is a corporation involved in the computer business. During the period relevant to this dispute, it operated a customer service center and other facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n2. Plaintiff was employed by defendant at its Philadelphia office from June 24, 1974, until February 14, 1990.\n3. IBM provides to its employees a number of benefit programs, including its Sickness and Accident Income Plan (\"S & A Plan\") and its Medical Disability Income Plan. As an IBM employee, plaintiff was eligible for defendant's benefit programs.\n4. Under the S & A Plan, an employee who misses work due to illness or injury is eligible for regular salary for each day of absence up to a maximum of 52 weeks in 24 consecutive months. In order to receive benefits under the S & A Plan, an employee must, upon request, submit a certificate of disability from his or her physician.\n5. Under the Medical Disability Income Plan, an employee who becomes disabled after five or more years of service is eligible for income until age 65.\n*fn1\"\nIn order to receive benefits under the Medical Disability Income Plan, an employee must offer satisfactory proof that the person suffers from a disability that prevents him or her from working. The disability must have existed for at least nine months and be the type of condition that will continue during the employee's lifetime. IBM may require a physical examination to determine the continuance of the disability.\n6. At IBM, employment is at will and can be terminated at any time. IBM's attendance policy requires employees to report to work each day as scheduled. According to the IBM employment handbook, an employee who fails to comply with the company's attendance requirements may be dismissed.\n7. IBM's medical department determines whether an employee's absence is medically justified. As part of its determination, the department evaluates information received from employees' doctors. In situations in which the medical diagnosis needs clarification, the medical department has a medical consultant conduct an independent evaluation. The consultant's assessment generally prevails over that of the employee's doctor.\n8. If the medical department finds a medical justification for the employee's absence, it will notify management that the absence is appropriate. If the medical department finds that the absence is not medically justified, it will notify management accordingly and management will handle the situation as if no medical issue is involved.\nB. Plaintiff's Employment History\n9. During the course of her employment, Ms. Cuff received a number of promotions. From 1987 until her termination in 1990, she held the position of senior customer center administrator.\n10. Ms. Cuff testified that in May 1988, she began to experience mental and physical problems including fatigue, weakness and an inability to concentrate. Her treating physician was Dr. Stanley Lane, who had a specialized practice in allergy and immunology.\n11. Plaintiff's condition did not improve. In September 1988, Ms. Cuff informed her supervisor, Ms. Donna Jennings, that she was ill. Plaintiff missed work from September 20 to September 23, 1988, and from September 29, 1988 to January 2, 1989. During this time, she was hospitalized for four days in November.\n12. Ms. Cuff received her full salary while absent.\n13. Pursuant to company policy, Ms. Jennings notified IBM's medical department of plaintiff's absence.\n14. Dr. Lane diagnosed plaintiff as having chronic Epstein-Barr Virus.\n*fn2\"\nHe also submitted a medical certificate to IBM's medical department identifying Epstein-Barr Virus as Ms. Cuff's illness.\n15. Dr. Lane sent Ms. Cuff to Dr. Lawrence Frenkel, who was director of the division of immunology, allergy and infectious diseases at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In December 1988, Dr. Frenkel performed a detailed examination of Ms. Cuff. In a letter to Dr. Lane, Dr. Frenkel stated that a \"review of [plaintiff's] systems except for . . . sinus problems and lethargy is essentially unremarkable. . . . the physical exam today is essentially unremarkable.\"\n*fn3\"\n16. Ms. Cuff returned to work in early January 1989. In a letter to Dr. Silverberg dated January 6, 1989, Dr. Lane stated that Ms. Cuff had \"recovered from her outbreak of EBV problems\" and that she \"has had an extensive immunologic work-up done, which, thus far, has shown normal results.\" Dr. Lane also advised against plaintiff performing any heavy manual labor or working overtime.\n17. On January 9, 1989, Dr. Timothy Tomasi, an IBM physician specialist, signed off on plaintiff's return-to-work slip. He did not evaluate Ms. Cuff before signing the slip. As discussed below, Dr. Tomasi was the primary IBM physician responsible for evaluating Ms. Cuff's health as it related to her employment.\n18. During the first five months of 1989, plaintiff missed only one full day and two half days due to illness.\n19. On June 13, 1989, Ms. Cuff reported that she was ill and left work early. She was absent from work for the rest of June, with the exception of three days: June 19, 21 and 26.\n20. On June 26, 1989, Ms. Jennings contacted Dr. Timothy Tomasi because Ms. Cuff had been out",

I did ask some strange questions, would I suffer? Would it be instantaneous that my urges would be gone? She reassured me that it would be instant and I would not suffer.\nI did have my last ever cigarette at 6pm on the 6th January 2015 and have not had any desire to smoke since.

    "context": "We moved from Urbana to Geneva, Illinois in 1994, and during our three years there I worked for the Kane County Cougars (a minor league baseball team) in their group sales office. The staff was young, and refreshingly unimpressed by my blindness. Amy Mason, a recent college grad, was the one who hired me. She figured I could help answer the phone, route calls, and take ticket orders.\nOn my first day on the job, however, we discovered one small problem: their phone system used lights, rather than sounds, to indicate which line was ringing. Unfazed, Amy had me make outgoing calls instead. The kind of calls they hated making\u2014contacting groups who hadn\u2019t paid up, or trying to interest schools in special promotions. I didn\u2019t much like these calls, either, but I figured it was a fair bargain. Free game tickets weren\u2019t bad either!\nThat\u2019s Flo throwing out the first pitch at the Cougars game on her 80th birthday. (Photo by Cheryl May.)\nI made a lot of friends at the Cougars during my years there, but I felt especially close to Amy. During one summer when our then-rambunctious-now responsible-nephew Robbie was staying with us, Amy took him out of my hair by putting him to work as an intern. She was a talented athlete and had played high school and college sports, and she cheered on my great-niece Anita, who was a toddler then, to become the basketball superstar she is today. Flo turned 80 in 1996, and when we all decided to invite friends and family to join us in celebrating FloFest in a big tent at a Cougars game, Amy was instrumental in making everything go smoothly, including making arrangements for Flo to throw out the first pitch. It rolled right over the plate.\nI sold a lot of tickets for the Cougars, and during my time there I helped the group sales office expand their schools program. Working with a minor league team\u2019s energetic, upbeat and goofy staff helped rebuild a lot of the confidence that had slipped away when I lost my sight.\nToday Amy Mason is the Director of Ticket Services and Community Relations for the Kane County Cougars, and the Cougars are now the A Team for the Chicago Cubs. The Pitch and Hit Club is honoring Amy with their Woman of the Year Award tomorrow night, and Mike, Whitney and I will be in the audience cheering her on.\nSome other notables will be there as well: former White Sox manager Tony La Russa and Hall of Famer Rich \u201cGoose\u201d Gossage are the headliners, and the entertainment will be provided by, who else? My beloved baseball organist Nancy Faust. The biggest star there, of course, will be Amy Mason. She still stands out as a model for how, with a little patience and very little fanfare, hiring someone with a disability can work out well. For everybody.\nNow that\u2019s a great story! Thanks Beth\nYou are welcome. As you might imagine, this is a very fun story to tell.\nOh Amy, clearly a saint for dealing with that brother of mine! Such great memories from the Kane County Cougars! Congrats to Amy, clearly much deserved!!\nTruth is, Amy was such a gifted manager that she pawned your brother Robbie off on another co-worker. Her name is Jennifer, just like yours, so of course Robbie took to her instantly.\nKane County Jennifer lives in Denver now \u2014 I caught up with her when Mike and I were out there last Fall. It will come as no surprise to you that she remembers Robbie and asked about him \u2013 imagine her surprise to learn he is a grown up dad now!\nthose games are so much fun\u2026..want to go to another one sometime. I can imagine that they have a great staff.\nCongratulations to Amy! She sounds like quite a girl and surely deserves the award! Enjoy the evening\u2026.sounds like it should be great.\nBeth, A big thanks to you and Mike for paying me a visit at last night\u2019s Pitch and Hit banquet. Your loyalty to and appreciation of Amy Mason is now very clear. I am proud to be her \u201cco-worker\u201d and certainly your ears will be buzzing when I have the opportunity to see her in the Spring. Loved meeting handsome Whitney. It\u2019s clear that she too, loves you.\nOh, Nancy, I enjoyed chatting with you Sunday night and then, especially, hearing all your clever songs throughout the evening.\nI lit up at every song you played. My personal fave was \u201cTie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\u201d for Tyrone Brooks. \u201cWildfire\u201d for award-winner Mike Pinto was a close second. And it goes without saying that \u201cMy Guy\u201d was the perfect tune for Tony La Russa, especially after he gave you that well-deserved compliment during his speech.\nMy friend Amy did the right thing by staying home Sunday night \u2013not worth risking the drive from the far western suburbs during an ice storm! \u2013 but I have a feeling you would have been ready for her if she\u2019d been there to accept her award: \u201cAmy\u2019 by Pure Prairie League? Or perhaps the old favorite \u201cOnce in Love with Amy.\u201d\nBeth, you keep the memory of the greatest aspect of my Sox career alive. And that\u2019s the special unforgettable folks I was privileged to meet. Much love- Nancy\n[\u2026] worked in the ticket office at the minor league A team called the Kane County Cougars when Kevin and Mike worked at Spyglass. We [\u2026]\n[\u2026] home games for the Cougars ever since retiring from her White Sox gig in 2008, and my friend Amy Mason is the Director of Ticket Operations for the Cougars.

The results of such tests are ignored. Thus when your test is x/;Unequal[x,1] Mathematica applies it only to those parts of the expression for which the test yields True or False and omits both the Head (List) and the entire expression since List==0 and {1,2,3}==0 return neither True nor False. Note that, however, Position[v, x_ /; (x != {1, 2})] {{}} Why? Mathematica only perfumed the test {1,2,3}=={1,2}, which returned {1, 2, 3} == {1, 2} False and did perform the tests List=={1,2} and 1=={1,2} etc, as these yield neither True nor False. In general then testing for position only tests that yield either True or False are performed, thus the Head of the expression is tested only if the test is of the kind that can yield True or False. (Of course if you call Position with the option Heads->False, the Head will be ignored in all cases). So Mathematica seems pretty smart here. How does it know when not to perform tests? This is not entirely clear to me. It is interesting to compare these two equivalent tests: Position[v, x_ /; Unequal[x,1]] {{2}, {3}} Position[v, x_ /; ! Equal[x,1]] {{2}, {3}} The outcomes are the same, but Trace results are quite different: Trace[Position[v,x_/;x!=1]] = {{v,{1,0,3}},Position[{1,0,3},x_/;x!=1],{1!=1,False},{0!=1,True},{3!=1,True},{{2},{3}}} Trace[Position[v,x_/;!x==1]] = {{v,{1,0,3}},Position[{1,0,3},x_/;!x==1],{!List==1,List!=1},{{1==1,True},!True,False},{{0==1,False},!False,True},{{3==1,False},!= False,True},{!{1,0,3}==1,{1,0,3}!=1},{{2},{3}}} Somehow in the first case there were no comparisons with List and the entire expression at all (or at least Trace does not show them). In the second case such comparisons were made but because they returned neither True nor False they were ignored. Why there is this difference I do not know.

What five things can't you live without?\nThe husband\nThe doggies\nCheese curds (I'm a WI girl)\nComfy shoes\nCulver's (most delicious fast food ever)\n2. How do you transport your dogs? This question suggested by several peeps, including Mara.\nAfter some stupid teenager ruined my old car I picked up what I call \"The Transporter\" earlier this year.\nIsn't it beautiful? It's a Subaru Outback and it pretty much always has crates rattling around in the back. And I usually have the back seats down so it's basically a two-seater most of the time. Sometimes I'm a little lazy and just throw all the dogs into one crate for very short trips but they don't mind.\nOh, and this baby has heated seats!!! YES!!! I pulled my hamstring last week so even though it's 90+ outside I'm riding around with my seat cranked up to high and it is awesome.\n3. What role does obedience play in your training or running of your dog(s)?\nI think that obedience is pretty boring so I try to do a lot of trick training. It helps my dogs learn how to learn and that it's okay to make mistakes. But I'm always working on a good recall and a fast down which both come in handy when it comes to agility.\n4. At what point do you start putting commands on your dogs?\nWhen I'm teaching something new I usually wait a day or so before I start adding the command. And then I start by having them do the trick and then saying \"Good [name of trick]\". Then I'll add in the command once they start to offer the trick without me having to lure them.\n5. Do you talk to strangers in elevators? Question posted by Laura #1.\nUmmm... sometimes there are scary people in elevators :)\nBwaahahaha. I think I might be the scary person in the elevator. hahaha\nLOVE your transporter.\nYou were #1! You go girl. :)\nBy the way... I had to go in and fix my button link, so you may want to go copy and repaste the button code. I'd messed up. Oopsie!\nGlad I'm not the only one bored by obedience. I fully admit that my dogs have \"agility obedience\" and that's it. They know enough to make them pleasant to live with and get around an agility course, so that works for me. All of that formal obedience stuff just doesn't appeal to me. Quite honestly, I can't even bring myself to do rally. Snore.... lol\nOMG, who talks to strangers in elevators? I try to not even make eye contact!! :o)\nYou & your Culvers... lol There is one down the street from me and I think I've been there twice, ever. Maybe that's for the best, though.\nLaura - thanks so much for starting this! And I fixed my button.\nKarissa - yeah, I totally think rally and obedience is boring. But it is quite amazing to watch our obedience instructor work with his dogs - they are brilliant. Maybe if I was ever that good with my dogs I might like it more :) I think I have an abusive relationship with Culver's - it breaks my nose but then keeps telling me it still loves me with those delicious cheese curds and frozen custard. I can't believe you live down the street from one!!",

Here are 5 sure ways of putting style and could potentially increase the chances of getting it off the market as quickly as you can!\nCountertop\nGives a dazzle to every kitchen indeed but you don\u2019t have to buy those expensive, high end granite or marble. You can try covering tired laminated tops with RustOleum\u2019s durable countertop transformation product or you may try using butcher-type block tops at IKEA.\nLighting\nA very important element that must not be ignored. Good lighting can transform your kitchen and make it look larger and highlights it\u2019s best feature. Perhaps you can install lighting under cabinets, over dining tables. Opt for light-emitting diode bulbs to conserve energy. If the bulb is compatible with dimmers, that would be a good extra bonus could be to show off.\nLayout\nSellers should consider redoing the layout, where possible. Have fun in rearranging things that you think could work. Buyers nowadays opt for an open kitchen design, with lots of space. Get on your creative side and think how you would like your kitchen to be, they\u2019d probably like it too.\nBacksplash\nTrust me, backsplashes can truly make a difference! There are a lot of self-adhesive tiles that are easy to install including modern patterns with different sizes, shapes and colors. Get some opinion on which pattern or color to use, and choose what you think would best compliment the house.\nCabinets\nGo with the affordable ones. Opt for a pressed than the solid wood interiors. Saving costs in replacing the cabinets helps lower the budget tremendously, as it represents more or less half of the remodeling cost. But if possible, consider those with good quality. You can try check out IKEA or you can repaint it with Ace Hardware\u2019s Cabinet, Door & Trim paint that yields out a finished result.\n>",

    "context": "Uncle\nBill Warner\nWal-Mart\nused to advertise that they \"bought American\" wherever\nthey could. At the same time, they were expanding their China operations\nby setting up a fake distributor called P.R.E.L., whose main job\nwas making sure shoppers did not connect Wal-Mart with their oriental\nsuppliers. American suppliers went out of business, as you cannot\ncompete with 18-cent-per hour wages. The factories Wal-Mart dealt\nwith were told they had to sell their goods cheaply, so they started\ndriving THEIR workers harder and paying them less. Soon, Wal-Mart\ndecided to start their own factories, which allowed them to reduce\nworkers wages even further. 60% of the largest factories in the\nworld belong to Wal-Mart. That, plus the 3,400 Wal-Mart stores in\nthe U.S. makes it a bit like the 2,000 lb. gorilla. It gets its\nway, and workers get less pay.\nNow, we all\nlike low prices, but there are hidden costs all the way from having\nto pay for the public assistance programs Wal-Mart associates are\noften forced into, to whole factories shutting down and putting\npeople out of work as Wal-Mart moves their operations overseas.\nPretty soon, there will be so many underpaid and unemployed workers\nin this country that the only place they will be able to afford\nto shop will be Wal-Mart. Henry Ford, back in the early days of\nthe automobile, raised his workers pay to $5 a day, more than anyone\nelse was paying, so they could afford to buy his cars. He got rich\nwith that philosophy, and his workers were better off. I wonder\nif the policy of paying your workers too little to live on in this\nday and age is going to someday come back and bite Wal-Mart? People\nwithout money can't buy things, even at low prices. Would the economy\nof this country improve if each of Wal-Mart's 1,200,000 employees\nhad an extra ten bucks in their pay envelope each week? Let's see,\nthat would amount to roughly to 12 million bucks of buying power\npumped back into the economy.\nEveryone is\naffected by Wal-Mart in many ways they don't even realize. When\na city pledges a couple of million bucks worth of infrastructure\n(roads, water line, sewage lines) plus tax breaks, that money is\nnot available for schools or fire stations.\nI wonder if\nformer garment workers, who lost their decent jobs when the work\nwent to China, can make it on what they earn part-time at Wal-Mart.\nI wonder what they would think selling $15.00 shirts made in Shanghai\nfor which the garment worker was paid 18 cents?\nOne of the\npoints made in the film, \"Wal-Mart--The High Cost of Low Price\"\nwas that in their cost-cutting, sometimes the whole community is\ndirectly affected for the worse. At one store by a river, bags of\nfertilizer and pesticides, some of them broken, were piled into\nthe parking lot without adequate cover (costs money) from the rain.\nThey leaked poisons into the river from which the townspeople got\ntheir drinking water. In other towns, un-patrolled store parking\nlots, even the ones which had cameras had and have high crime rates\nincluding theft, kidnapping, rape, and even murder. All because\nit would cost Wal-Mart money to hire a motorized patrol officer.\nThank goodness Porterville is not one of these!\nThe family\nof Sam Walton, Wal-Mart's founder, is the richest in the world.\nThey are worth 90 billion dollars. Wal-Mart has given 1% of its\nwealth to charity. That may sound like a lot until you note that\nBill Gates has given 58% of his wealth to charity! In all fairness,\nWal-Mart did give $6,000 to an employee emergency benefit fund.\nWhile we're talking money, let's note that the company CEO, Lee\nScott, makes $27,000,000 dollars a year while the average \"associate\"\nmakes less than $14,000. The next time you hear a Wal-Mart commercial\ntelling you that \"people come first,\" you will certainly\nknow which people they are talking about.\nThe next time\nyou buy something at Wal-Mart made in one of their Chinese factories,\nthink of the person who spent a 14-hr day in the factory to make\n$3.00 a day.

Ours acquiesced to Salem, Massachusetts, a town once gripped by hysterical youths diming out their elders. Sounds like fun!\nWe brought along the hound from hell, but the receptionist at the pet-friendly Salem Inn, an elegant conjunction of three Colonial townhomes, didn\u2019t even glance at our 120-pound mutt as she handed me the key to our suite. It had exposed beams, a kitchenette, a Jacuzzi, a pullout couch and a daybed for the kids, a queen-size for us, and a petite balcony overlooking rooftops the kids recognized from the movie Hocus Pocus. They were downright tingly.\nFor a smallish town, Salem has a jumpin\u2019 street life. We dined on lobster rolls and clam chowder outdoors at Lobster Shanty on Artists Row, two doors down from an African drum shop. Then we walked to the Salem Witch Memorial, a solemn stone tribute to the 1692 trials that left 20 dead.\nIn the darkness, we wandered out to the quays and admired the grand Custom House where Nathaniel Hawthorne once toiled. The next day, after the hardy breakfast the Salem Inn provides, we toured the House of the Seven Gables, which the kids dubbed \u201ccool\u201d thanks to the hidden staircase and a lively guide. I filled my daughter in on the plot of The Scarlet Letter, and she was properly outraged: \u201cThat is so unfair!\u201d We bought Black Jacks and Gibralters at Ye Olde Pepper Candy Companie, the nation\u2019s oldest confectionery. At the pre-1700 Witch House, there were grumbles of false advertising from black-clad Wiccans (who throng here from all over): The sole connection to the trials is that a judge lived there. But Salem has tons of tacky witch-related sites, including two wax museums.\nWe dined at Rockafellas, in a former bank, on crab fritters, more clam chowder, and pear salad, then descended on the Peabody Essex Museum, which the New York Times dubbed \u201ca cross-cultural marvel,\u201d with its maritime collection and the world\u2019s largest assemblage of Asian export art. Equally impressive is the town\u2019s architecture, with post-medieval, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate homes.

As the sun rose into the valley we rose off the desert floor and through some truely amazing flora. The cacti in this particular area completely transported me and lifted my spirits.

Gayl\nIf you ladies are already strong enough to be doing this kind of mileage, and are wiling to get up @ 4:30am to accommodate the trail, then you should be fine in the Sierra.\nWhen there\u2019s snow, if really doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 10\u2033 or 10\u2032 deep, either way you\u2019re walking over snow. The key is to adapt to the trail as it dictates the situation (just like you\u2019re doing in the desert right now). For the Sierra, that means getting over the passes between 7-9am. If that means getting up @ 4am and hiking in freezing pre-dawn for 3 hours before reaching a pass, then that\u2019s what needs to be done.\nHiking during the spring in the Sierra is one of life\u2019s great experiences. Those who do it never forget. I go every year about the time PCTers are heading north from KM. Whatever you do, don\u2019t let anyone try and talk you out of doing it if the conditions and weather are ok ie 6/15 ->\nHere\u2019s a trip report from last year to give you a sense of what it\u2019s like:\nHey Hobbes, thanks for your words of encouragement. We are definitely leaning towards waiting for the snows to melt a bit before going into the Sierras.",

    "context": "It\u2019s been a while since my last post (sorry!!). I\u2019ve hand my hands full these past few weeks with finals, Coco, and Thanksgiving. Now that things are a little bit back to normal and I am officially on winter break, I have time to write a long post about what I\u2019ve been up to.\nMy finals in Studio Issues and Stitch, Object as Language went really well! I\u2019ll start with what I did in my Stitch class. I finished three 12 X 6 canvases of embroidery. The title of the piece is called Time Frames and each canvas represents a season. I finished Summer for my midterm and then I finished Fall and Winter for my final. I still have to do Spring and am planning on having it finished by the end of December. As you can see they were very time consuming and I\u2019m very proud of how they turned out. The seasons informed my colors and thought process for each piece. I did a lot of writing while I embroidered these pieces, but am only going to share a little bit of what I was thinking. My work is moving into the realm of collective memory so my personal memories are becoming obsolete for my viewers. I think writing about both personal and collective memory is very important to my work, but part of it is just for me.\nFall \u2013 I was thinking a lot about changes and how nature starts to change but at the same time the structure is still the same. The frames haven\u2019t completely lost their shape, but have changed in a distinctive way. The forms are starting to hollow out and prepare for the next step. The colors aren\u2019t flat and the same like they were in Summer. They are blended, vibrant and consistent. Certain colors are the same throughout all the seasons and I kept this the same in my embroidery.\nWinter \u2013 This is where things are drastically changed. The structure is the most important and most seen element in the winter. This is where things start to distort and deconstruct. I thought a lot about a quiet still moment in the winter. The moment where the leaves are all gone and the branches finally get to be seen. Snow is sitting on the branches and it\u2019s a perfect winter moment. There are areas of extreme change and consistency. If you look carefully you see an image of a face, but at first glance you aren\u2019t really sure what you are seeing. Again, these colors are appropriate to the season but a few of them are in the other two seasons as well.\nHere is a detail of Winter.\nThis is where I need your feedback. I\u2019m not sure if I should hang these horizontal or vertical. So when you have a change please let me know what you prefer.\nNow moving on to my Studio Issues final. I worked on simple daily drawings as part of my thought process on how to start translating my work into metal. Since I didn\u2019t have the resources to work with metal yet I did a lot of studies (paper and drawing) so that next quarter I will have a good idea of what I want to make. I also continued to work with my screen printing compositions. I decided to present them in shadow boxes and make a collage with different prints. I was thinking about dressers and vanities and how people put precious objects on them. Sometimes they put boxes with precious objects in them on either a dresser or vanity. I\u2019ve been researching the Victorian era, mourning jewelry, and artists like Joseph Cornell and Anne Wilson. I\u2019ve always had a fascination with tiny precious objects so that is the direction my work is going.\nThese are the last of my daily drawings which makes 70 (one for each day of the quarter). YAY!!!\nThese are my metal studies. I cut forms out of paper and then painted and stitched them together. Next quarter when I\u2019m in my metals and jewelry class I want to make objects like these.\nThis is my final presentation for my Studio Issues class.\nRight after finals were over I went to the Columbia Museum of Art in Columbia, SC. It was a charming little art museum. I went to see Dale Chihuly\u2019s Seaforms exhibition. It was set up as clusters of sea forms and some of his drawings were on display as well. The colors were beautiful and his compositions were inspirational. I was really excited that I got to see his work and hopefully will see it again sometime.\nThis week I\u2019m going to Sarasota, FL to visit my aunt and uncle. I\u2019ll also be going to the American Craft Show in Sarasota. I\u2019m really excited to be able to visit family and see this show! I\u2019m going to leave you with a few new pictures of Coco and I\u2019ll post again when I\u2019m back in Savannah.\nAbby~I like your new posting. I know that you spent hours on your canvases. I think that I like them hung horizontally the best. Your metal studies are very interesting. Coco is precious!",

    "context": "Four years ago, traded life policy (TLP) funds were labelled as potential replacements for with-profit funds. Three years ago, certain fund providers were pushing for their own IMA sector.\nLast week these same fund providers stated that TLP funds were never intended for the retail fund-buying community after the FSA labelled them \u201chigh risk, toxic products that are generally unsuitable for the majority of UK investors\u201d.\nWhen a fund makes its return by estimating the date of someone\u2019s death, marketing is always going to be tricky. This task was made no easier when, in August 2006, the American viatical marketmaker Mutual Benefits Corporation (MBC) was prosecuted for fraud. It was found guilty of understating the life expectations of policyholders, which therefore increased the value of their policies.\nDespite this, in the years afterwards several funds have been launched to British investors, with the promise of returns uncorrelated to those of equities or bonds. Indeed, back in 2007 a report issued by Professor Merlin Stone of the Bristol Business School, said TLPs might be the best alternative to with-profit funds. For this to happen however, the report said more needed to be done to raise the profile of TLP funds among IFAs. (Comment continues below)\nA year later, some TLP product providers said they wanted to lobby the IMA to create a new sector to help promote the asset class. This never happened, given their offshore domiciles and lack of Ucits III status, but the thinking was that a peer group would help promote the asset class, with retail investors in mind.\nOdd, then, that these same providers are now at pains to point out that the funds were only ever aimed at \u201csophisticated investors\u201d (see news analysis, page 12).\nOwing to liquidity constraints, TLP funds have never been able to be packaged as Ucits III funds, and last week\u2019s FSA statement will likely be the death knell to any groups looking to change this.\nThe key problem has always been what happens if a fund runs out of cash and cannot continue paying the life assurance premiums. If this happens, the policies effectively become worthless.\nMost of the groups, to give them their due, have always stated that an education drive has been needed to increase demand, but is this drive alone enough to transform so-called retail investors into sophisticated investors?\nJust last month, Managing Partners told Fund Strategy it deals with retail investors as long as they are sufficiently sophisticated. However, it added that it is down to the IFA to categorise who is sophisticated and who is not.\nSL Investment Management, which has long maintained TLP funds are not suitable for retail investors, puts IFAs in the same category because they rely on the people selling the product for information.\nThere are far more problems with this investment than understated life expectancy and companies running out of funds to pay premiums. In the US there are hundreds of lawsuits filed to void policies issued to seniors who fraudulently acquired insurance. In some cases courts allowed insurers to cancel the policies and keep the premiums.\nSome of these fraud cases insured a retired bus driver for millions; people living in low cost housing whose income is limited to government benefits; a man who filed for bankruptcy two years earlier with a net worth of minus.\nSo-called sophisticated investors are not as sophisticated as they would like to think of themselves. They do not know half of what they need to know.\nWould you invest with a principal whose previous company, doing the same exact thing, went belly-up and was cited in court for selling fraudulent policies to investors. Too many of these con artists recycle themselves, new company name, new state, new investors, new funds, same-old fraud.\nMs Wolk\u2019s comments are quite pertinent in understanding some of the problems with running a TLP fund. There is too much unknown.\nIn theory the process should be relatively straightforward in that the statistics are reasonably well founded, so the capital and cash flow requirements are quantifiable, allowing sufficient prudent margin for changes in life expectancy. Whilst this may not make for a mainstream investment, it should not require a \u201csophisticated\u201d investment label.\nWhat is making these funds so high risk is incompetent management and a heavy level of fraud. Since we have been aware of these two elements for quite some time now (the Shepherds Fund collapsed in 2005) it is amazing that the FSA have been so slow to raise questions. Competent management and fraud should be a high priority on their regulatory agenda. It is clear from other scandals that they do not have the tools or the understanding to do such a job.\nRebranding these policies as \u201cSophisticated\u201d is real head in the sand stuff. Whilst wealthy people may be able to withstand such scandals better than the less wealthy it is no more palatable. And when the losses are predominantly based on fraud and incompetence, and not market conditions, then there is no justification for exposing the wealthy to such risk.\nUntil this basis of this market it cleaned up it should be banned. It is totally impractical to assume that advisers can do the background work to ensure that funds are being properly run; there has to be a certain level of trust for the market to run at a reasonable cost level.\nIf the FSA are out of their depth then that I would strongly recommend that advisers stop using these funds until either the providers can demonstrate explicitly a satisfactory level of prudent management, or, as a group, provide a copper bottomed level of guarantee on future behaviour and returns. This may be hard on the reputable providers, but the never ending loses have been a darn sight harder on the purses of honest investors.",

    "context": "Our humble blogger celebrates National Puppy Day by introducing his new puppy, just five days in to her new surroundings.\nMy wife Theresa has a theory about dogs, specifically about the number of dogs necessary to maintain a happy home. In her mind, three is the ideal number; that way, when one of the dogs goes to that great doggy daycare in the sky (as dogs do), the two remaining pups have each other to keep themselves occupied. (Yes, you could have one dog at a time, but that would inevitably leave you dogless for certain intervening periods, which is entirely unacceptable.)\nWith that in mind, since we lost our 10-year-old golden retriever Corona late last year, our household has been out of equilibrium, doggie-wise. Sally, our 6-year-old golden (and Corona\u2019s daughter) and Penny, our 9-year-old yellow Lab, were clearly out of sorts and desperately in need of a puppy in their lives. (So declared Theresa, referring strictly to them and not at all to herself.)\nAnd so just this past weekend we welcomed Daisy, a.k.a. Daisy Mae, an 8-week-old golden who immediately restored order by gnawing vigorously on our pant legs.\nOnce you've gone a while without a puppy, it's always surprising just how small and fluffy they are. Not to mention awash in that new-puppy smell that makes you throw social norms to the wind and start grabbing their little heads and talking to them in what, to the uninitiated, would probably sound like a cross between unhinged gibberish and Jar-Jar Binks.\nI should mention that negotiations on naming rights for the puppy began well before we even knew who she was or where she was coming from. \u201cMookie\u201d was an early favorite, proposed by my son and covering several generations of sports greatness, from Mookie Wilson to Mookie Betts. (And of course New Jersey Nets point guard Mookie Blaylock, which was also the original band name for Pearl Jam. True story.)\nBut since it\u2019s a general rule that you have to fight about a pet\u2019s name for weeks before actually settling on one, \"Mookie\" fell out of favor and we wound up going down several different paths (\u201cBrady\u201d around Super Bowl time, \u201cPrincess Leia\u201d after Carrie Fisher's untimely passing, etc.) before arriving at Daisy. It\u2019s a versatile name that may be a reference to Daisy Buchanan of \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d if you ask Theresa, or Daisy Johnson of \u201cMarvel\u2019s Agents of Shield\u201d if you ask me. (Three guesses as to who is the \u201clow culture\u201d representative in our household.)\nI didn\u2019t realize when we got Daisy on Saturday that National Puppy Day was only a few days off because, let\u2019s face it, every day is National Puppy Day. (At least on the Internet.) But given the fortuitous timing, it seemed appropriate to mark the day with this photo study of Daisy\u2019s five-day tenure with us thus far, much of it devoted to her sleeping habits, since sleeping is what puppies do when they're not biting your pants leg.",

He is currently the publisher at Ford Street Publishing (), an imprint of Hybrid Publishers and his website is:\n1. The Quentaris Chronicles have been a great success, with 26 titles in the series through Lothian, and another, second series that you\u2019ll be publishing yourself. What was your inspiration for creating this shared world? What differences will we see with the second series?\nThe shared-world scenario was initially Michael Pryor\u2019s idea. He called me one day and asked if I\u2019d like to collaborate. Michael studied renaissance Florence at university and has visited Florence twice. So we had the architecture, and even the political system, population, guilds, etc. Basically Quentaris is a replica of that city in the early 1300s. What makes Quentaris a fantasy city is the mountain range behind it which is dotted by a thousand caves, all of which take travellers to other worlds. In the new series, Quentaris is lifted from its bedrock by the Spell of Undoing. A saboteur (think Zachary Sm. This second series is sequential whereas the first series are stand-alone books. Series #2 will also be illustrated by Fernando Molinari. Jeremy Maitland-Smith is also illustrating the new city. Alyssa Brugman has written the sequel and Isobelle Carmody will be writing the third book.\n2. You have a long history in publishing SF in Australia, starting with Void magazine in 1975, a succession of anthologies and novels in the eighties, but then giving it up to concentrate on your own writing. What, then, has motivated you to set up your new company Ford Street Publishing? You\u2019ll be publishing children and YA fiction \u2013 did you feel there was a gap in the market you could fill?\nAs you point out, I started out as a publisher. I only ceased because a shonky distributor disappeared with all my stock \u2013 including A Bertram Chandler\u2019s last book \u2013 and money. In those days independent presses could only get small press distributors. So: one or two salespeople across Australia. When I realised I could get a major publisher distributing my books, I jumped at the chance to get back into publishing. I doubt there\u2019s a \u201cgap\u201d I can fill, but the two books I\u2019ve published so far were both rejected by Australian publishers, yet both Before the Storm (Sean McMullen) and Pool (Justin D\u2019Ath) have received rave reviews. Pool sold 1550 copies before its release. Publishers make mistakes \u2013 go no further than the Harry Potter phenomenon \u2013 rejected by who knows how many publishers (I\u2019ve read between ten and nineteen) and yet the series is one of the world\u2019s all-time bestsellers. It\u2019s these books that slip through the cracks that I primarily hope to pick up on. Doubtless once I\u2019m established, authors will send their MSS to me first.\n3. You do school visits and workshop with school children and libraries. What value do you see in these visits \u2013 both to yourself and to the kids?\nAll modesty aside, students get to meet authors who they consider celebrities. For that one-hour session, the students will pay more attention to someone they admire than their standard teacher. I bring to the table thirty years of experience in publishing, where to get ideas, writing, editing, presentation and marketing. Teachers aren\u2019t expected to know all of this stuff. Many teachers tell me afterwards how good the workshop was in that they could take away practical exercises that they\u2019ll be able to re-use time and time again. I even get teachers emailing me for further resources. As for me, I keep in touch with my market. I get instant feedback. I even gave out questionnaires to students around the country regarding the title to my book The Forgotten Prince. I gave a thousand or so students a list of six titles and asked them which one they would choose as the best title.\n4. Enough about the writing (and publishing), what\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve read this year?\nTake your pick of Colfer\u2019s Artemis Fowl or Reeve\u2019s Mortal Engines books. I\u2019m also fond of The Edge Chronicles.\n5. Finally, and certainly most inappropriately, you\u2019re given the opportunity to get it on with the fictional character you fancy most. Who will it be and why?\nEasily Modesty Blaise. She\u2019s Lara Croft but much, much more. Amazonian, intelligent, ethical. A well-rounded woman who has foibles. Let\u2019s not forget she was head of a criminal organisation! I\u2019d gladly be her Willie Garvin.",

But how much do you really know about that delicious brown beverage that has become a part of your morning routine? Pour yourself a cup and find out with these 15 delightful coffee facts.\n1. Coffee lovers have a herd of dancing goats to thank.\nAccording to legend, an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi noticed that whenever his goats munched on the bright red berries of an unusual tree on his property, they\u2019d become euphoric and energized. So Kaldi did what any curious goat herder would and tried some of the berries himself. It wasn\u2019t long before he was dancing along with his herd, earning himself the moniker of \u201cthe happiest herder in happy Arabia.\u201d\n2. Coffee was originally chewed, not sipped.\nA cup of Joe may be your preferred method of consumption, but coffee has not always been a liquid treat. According to a number of historians, the first African tribes to consume coffee did so by grinding the berries together, adding in some animal fat, and rolling these caffeinated treats into tiny edible balls of energy. It wasn\u2019t until 1000 CE that the beans were turned into a beverage (a special wine, to be exact).\n3. Not everyone was a quick coffee convert.\nAs recently as the 18th century, governments were trying to stamp out coffee because it stimulated both drinkers and radical thinking. In 1746 Sweden took things to an extreme when it banned both coffee and coffee paraphernalia (i.e. cups and saucers).\n4. Beer tried to take coffee\u2019s spot at the breakfast table.\nThree decades after Sweden locked down ceramics, Prussian officials grew worried that coffee consumption was interfering with citizens\u2019 beer-drinking habits. In 1777, Frederick the Great of Prussia issued a statement encouraging Prussians to drink beer\u2014not coffee\u2014with their breakfast.\n5. Instant coffee is nearly 250 years old.\nConvenience has long been a concern for coffee drinkers, as evidenced by the fact that instant coffee made its first appearance in England in 1771. The process evolved over the years until the first mass-produced instant coffee was introduced\u2014and patented\u2014in the U.S. in 1910. And it continued to evolve into the 1960s, when freeze-dried coffee (still a popular method) made its debut.\n6. Americans don\u2019t drink all that much java.\nIt may seem like there\u2019s a coffee shop on every corner of every major city in the U.S.\u2014and usually another on the other side of the street\u2014but Americans place 25th when it comes to the amount of coffee we consume.\n7. Finland is the world\u2019s coffee king.\nThe world\u2019s most caffeinated country? Finland! Though the country doesn\u2019t produce any beans of its own, Finnish drinkers still manage to consume almost three times as much coffee as Americans each year. Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and the Netherlands round out the top five (in that order).\n8. All the hippest cats drink it.\nThe record holder for the title \u201coldest cat ever\u201d\u2014a cat named Cr\u00e8me Puff\u2014lived to be 38 years and three days old. She drank coffee every morning of her life, plus bacon, eggs, and broccoli, too. Before you dismiss that as just an unrelated coincidence, consider this: the cat that Creme Puff beat out for the record\u201434-year-old Grandpa Rex Allen\u2014had the same owner, and was fed the exact same diet.\n9. It could fuel your car someday.\nMore than 100 million Americans rely on coffee to get their personal motors running each morning. And at some point in the future, it could be the fuel that gets their cars\u2019 motors running, too. Researchers have had great success in converting coffee into biodiesel. Best of all, used grounds work just as well.\n10. The coffee break has a hometown.\nStoughton, Wisconsin bills itself as the place where the coffee break originated. Every year the town holds a Coffee Break Festival to celebrate this major contribution to the days of workers everywhere. According to local lore, the area\u2019s coffee-loving Norwegian immigrants created the breaks in the late 19th century.\n11. Beethoven was a barista\u2019s nightmare.\nBeethoven enjoyed a cup of java, and he was particular about its preparation\u2014he insisted that each cup of coffee was made with exactly 60 beans.\n12. Balzac knew how to toss it back.\nFrench writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac didn\u2019t have time to be that picky. He allegedly drank upwards of 50 cups of coffee a day.\n13. Coffee has been high fashion.\nDuring the Civil War, Union blockades of the South kept the Confederacy in a permanently under-caffeinated state. Confederate troops tried their hand at creating substitutes using chicory and dandelions, but nobody\u2019s taste buds were fooled. Coffee eventually became so prized that Southern jewelers used individual beans as gemstones in their creations.\n14. \u201cMocha\u201d is more than just a fun word to say.\nIt\u2019s also a port city on the Red Sea in Yemen. Until the 17th century, nearly all of the world\u2019s coffee was produced in the Middle East, and thanks to its ideal location for shipping, Mocha was the world\u2019s top coffee marketplace. Although the expansion of coffee cultivation to European colonies in South America and Asia eventually diminished Mocha\u2019s commercial power, beans exported from Mocha had been so popular in Europe that \u201cmocha\u201d became shorthand for any top-flight coffee.\n15. Asian palm civets make great baristas.\nKopi Luwak, the world\u2019s most expensive coffee, earns its pricey distinction thanks to a surprising step in its production: digestion. In Indonesia, a wild animal known as the Asian palm civet (a small critter similar to the weasel) cannot resist the bright red coffee cherries that abound, even though they can\u2019t digest the actual coffee beans. The beans pass through the civets' systems without being fully digested.\nEventually, some brave coffee farmer collected these beans from civets' droppings, thoroughly washed them, and tried brewing a cup. Surprisingly, the interaction with the civets\u2019 digestive juices did something magical to the beans, resulting in a cup of coffee that was intensely flavorful and lacked any trace of bitterness. The process may not sound very appetizing, but the really tough thing to stomach is the price\u2014a single pound of Kopi Luwak can set you back more than $600.\nLike a great cup of espresso or a delicious latte, GEICO\u2019s delightful customer service will leave you feeling perky, energized, and happy.",
    "question": "What is the origin of coffee according to the legend?",
    "answer": "According to legend, an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi noticed that whenever his goats munched on the bright red berries of an unusual tree on his property, they\u2019d become euphoric and energized. So Kaldi tried some of the berries himself and it wasn\u2019t long before he was dancing along with his herd.",

Future purchases are easy.. you mandate a certain portion of your profits is reinvested in the local you're getting the resources from.. some sort of 'growing industry/infastructure/invest in the local region.Past..and current purchases are where you have problems.And then you have 'in perpetuity' issues like the corporate owning of water rights.. forever. That is a dangerous dangerous road to be walking down. Fun note.. conservative estimates is that something like 15 to 20% of all fresh water in the planetary ecosystem goes through South America. Which as the planet population grows and the water reserves continue to shrink WIll be a problem. Mexico is already tapping aquifers that no one in the US is using (aside from hazardous waste dumping) So eventually we'll have to get our water from SOMEONE and no one seems to think desalinization is a viable technoolgoy to invest in.\nI would argue that a vast imbalance of power leads to the exact sort of indefinite cycles of abuse you're worried about. And while we're used to thinking of the state as having greater power than anybody else on its turf... in the case of a poor nation vs several multinational corporations, it really doesn't. The threat of force is one of the few tools the state has access to that corporations cannot match, so I'm pretty loath to call it unacceptable and take it off the table in a case like this. Especially when the data are already in and the end result was huge amounts of benefit to the population at large.\nI would argue that a state with proper checks and balances and an (even partly) informed public has more control of those assets in the public's interest than any corporation will ever have. Take a look at the table of psychopathy and your average multinational. Corporate 'persons' are very psychotic as a whole.\nI would say this he had issues but so did Stalin but most at the time considered Stalin a necessary evil for the USSR. The same thing here Chavez is dead but he left a strong major party supported by many of the people who are populist socialist in leaning or in frankly serious support. That party will support a new leader who I hope maintains the good reforms in their constitution and then make policy changes to be a better national party. I don't think two or more parties there would be bad no one would risk alienating the common citizen and go back to what was there before Chavez.He did in fact push for universal health care, built schools, channeled the vast oil wealth largely to the people and did install a new constitution much of it has lofty and noble goals. Those things are no small achievements in a lifetime.\nPage created in 0.05 seconds with 26 queries.",

We all know that vegetables are good for us, it\u2019s been drilled into us our entire lives.\nBut when you\u2019re trying to lose weight you want to minimize the calories as much as you can. Now all veg are good for you and provides their own source of nutrients that benefits your health in some way or the other. So you should never consider cutting any of them out before speaking to your doctor.\nBut if you\u2019re trying to cut back on calories, maybe you could eat more of the non starchyveg as appose to the starchy veg. Vegetables come in two categories and the non starchy has less calories.\nTaken from livestrong.com here are some nonstarchy veg that you can include in your diet to aid your weight loss\n6 Nonstarchy Vegetables To Help You Lose Weight\nBroccoli\nYou can enjoy broccoli in a couple of different ways while losing weight. Blanch it, chill it and have it with a fat-free dressing as an afternoon snack, or steam it in the microwave and include it as part of your entree. Not only is broccoli low in calories, 25 calories per 1/2-cup cooked portion, but it also contains lutein and zeaxanthin. You need these carotenoids to keep your eyes healthy and prevent age-related eye problems.\nSpinach\nSpinach is one of several nonstarchy vegetables you can include in your diet, without feeling guilty. A 1-cup serving of raw spinach leaves provides approximately 10 calories and 0.7 grams of fiber. You need plenty of fiber in your weight loss plan, since it takes awhile to pass through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full for hours. Make sure you consume 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories in your diet, advises the Linus Pauling Institute.\nEggplant\nEggplant is a rich and hearty vegetable that will leave you satisfied after every meal. A 3 1/2-ounce portion of grilled eggplant has about 35 calories and 2.5 grams of fiber. Eggplant is also naturally rich in folate, a B vitamin that aids in absorbing and metabolizing protein from the foods you eat.\nSalad Greens\nSalad greens, like romaine, iceberg and Boston lettuce, are considered \u201cfree foods,\u201d the American Dietetic Association explains. Free foods are highly beneficial for your diet plan, because they offer less than 20 calories and fewer than 5 grams of carbs per 1 cup serving.\nTomatoes\nTomatoes are a delicious guilt-free addition to your salad, sandwich or grilled kebob. Each 1 cup-portion of cherry tomatoes has around 25 calories, 2 grams of protein and nearly 2 grams of fiber. Additionally, tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a carotenoid that is beneficial for cancer prevention, says the Linus Pauling Institute.\nBaby Carrots\nSnacking on baby carrots in the middle of the afternoon can help curb your appetite until dinner. Enjoying 1 cup of baby carrots provides a minimal 25 calories and 2 g of protein. They are also a quick way to add 2.5 grams of fiber into your diet. An additional benefit of carrots to your weight loss regimen: they\u2019re rich in beta-carotene, another carotenoid that keeps your eyes working their best. See the entire list here.\nSo don\u2019t stop eating your vegetables, they\u2019re beneficial in more ways than one, not just for weight loss.\nLately I\u2019ve been eating a lot of spinach, I can\u2019t get enough of the stuff. Only yesterday I added half a bag of it to my chicken pasta dish, it\u2019s so easy and versatile and can be added to most meals. Eat it raw in a salad or throw a couple of handful into your cooked meals it\u2019s that simple.\nI hope this article was helpful, you can let me know clicking \u201cLike\u201d below.",

This is much like looking at a snow-covered mountain from a peaceful valley on a sunny day. You only need to start climbing to discover how rugged and harsh the beautiful mountain is. To get close to the mountain and begin your ascent is increasingly physical and emotional. It is full of risk and careful discernment.\nWe are called to climb higher and stretch to the limits of our love for God and man.\nC.S. Lewis said,.[1]\nIn Jesus\u2019 humanness we discover a pattern for how we may love\u2014starting with a childlike heart for Abba. The purity of Jesus\u2019 love is fatal to our unregenerate self.

Jesus invites us to come to him and drink. Whoever is thirsty and believes in him will have the river of his life flowing out from the innermost being (John 7:37-38). We are not to be merely spellbound by what we see in the emotional Jesus; we are to be unbound by his Spirit so that his life becomes our life, his emotions our emotions, to be \"transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory.\"[2]\n[2] G.

We taught two of the big puppets one of our dances and had them dance it with us, which was soooo funny and awesome! My parents happened to be there, and I gave my camera to my dad to take pics, and he took a few of us, but none of the big puppets dancing. What! Thanks a lot, Dad! I kept trying to signal him to take pics, but he didn\u2019t see me. Grrrr! I hope someone got pics/video\u2026!\nWe also made a little tour around the Fest grounds, and stopped to do dances for a couple of shops. They really seemed to enjoy that, and being out on different parts of the grounds than we normally see was nice. It worked well.\nAt one point, I gave Marusia (the 4-year old daughter of two of our adult dancers) the sticks to play during one of our songs, and after that she wanted to play them or the tambourine every time, going into our director\u2019s pouch to get the sticks out or taking the tambourine from her belt.

    "context": "(btckeychain / Flickr)\nInternet comments are often somewhat Hobbesian: nasty, brutish and short. So every week we make a point of highlighting some of the more thoughtful and reasoned exchanges that take place on our blog.\nBitcoin advocates met with federal regulators this past week to explain how the technology works. In response to our coverage, user bannedagain5446 charged that Bitcoin isn't a currency:\nIt's a scrip payment, or a speculation, or a form of discounted paper, but the one thing that it ISN'T is currency!\nThe claim touched off a long conversation \u2014 supported with evidence! \u2014 about the difference between currency, legal tender and barter. The distinctions aren't just academic; in fact, it's a good bet federal officials were having much the same discussion themselves behind closed doors.\nIn another post, my colleague Tim wrote about a high-profile GAO report finding that software patents just don't work. Arguing against fixed-term patents, reader zosima suggested an alternative:\nI'd prefer a term of protection that grants a limited monopoly until an investment has been recouped. We want patents to promote investment, if an idea doesn't require much investment, it doesn't deserve much protection. Many software patents are new ideas that nonetheless don't deserve a 20-year government enforced monopoly because they would occur to anyone working on the problem after two seconds thought.\nAfter writing that the line between metadata and content is sometimes very thin, Tim received a comment from reussere pointing out a conundrum for the NSA:\nEveryone knows that a trivial workaround for tracking metadata is a simple disposable phone. Given that their costs are so low (around 20 bucks), and the fact they are sold practically everywhere, makes me wonder just how effective the NSA program truly is.\nWould-be tipsters for The Switch, take note.",

    "context": "There are many good reasons to start DIY projects, and the advantages are multiplied when those projects become habits. Doing things on our own equates to a whole lot of savings, and that\u2019s more money in our pockets. It also empowers us with the knowledge and experience to recognize that we indeed still have the skills to do stuff rather than simply buy stuff. Plus, DIY procedures allow us the opportunity to be more ecologically responsible than a large factory might be, and that usually means they are healthier options as well.\nAs the new year arrives, undoubtedly people have resolutions on their mind, and picking up some DIY routines would be a great route to go in that regard. Not only will they save us money, empower us, protect the environment, and improve our health, but it is also just plain rewarding to accomplish stuff, to say I made that, or I\u2019m doing this because I care. So, here are some fantastic habits to focus on in the coming year.\n1. Growing Food\nSoon, the spring will roll around, and it\u2019ll be the ideal time to get a garden going. Let this year be the year to try producing some food at home. Start with some easy, quick growing foods and feel the benefits of healthy, homegrown produce. This is a wonderful hobby! It provides something useful, keeps gardeners active, reduces food miles, and improves health. Whether it is container gardens, productive patios, or full-on food forests, this year \u2014 any year \u2014 is a great time to start growing food.\n2. Fermenting Food\nAs long as growing food is on the agenda, preserving food is a great endeavor to put in the mix. There is canning, pickling, dehydrating, and freezing, but fermenting is the only preservation method that can actually improve the nutritional value of food. It happens through the probiotic bacteria that go to work in fermentation. This actually makes our guts healthier, which bolsters our immune systems. It\u2019s super cheap and easy to do. And, it\u2019s lots of fun!\n3. (Home)making Toiletries\nSadly, the most commonly used toiletries, chemical-based deodorants and so on, are increasingly being linked to chronic diseases and disorders. They are also expensive. Fortunately, it\u2019s very simple to make cheap, effective toiletries at home out of natural ingredients. Not only will this save DIY-ers money and benefit their health, but the environmental impact \u2014 less packaging, less reliance on petroleum products \u2014 is noteworthy, too.\n4. Repurposing Stuff\nRepurposing, for many, insinuates craftiness, and while this can be part of it, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be all of it. Repurposing can be as simple as looking for goods \u2014 lumber, electronics, clothing, appliances, furniture, instruments, etc. \u2014 second-hand before buying new ones. For DIY-ers, this can equate to serious savings, interesting creative twists, and rewarding projects, such as building cool items out of pallets.\n5. (Home)making Cleaning Products\nMuch like chemical-based toiletries, it turns out many of the chemical cleaners we commonly use at home are a risk to our health. The fumes can cause respiratory problems, and there are many other lingering effects. Again, the solution is simple, and with only a handful of natural items, an entire host of cleaning products can be easily whipped up to keep the house sparkling and sanitary.\n6. Building Soil\nFor those who are looking to grow themselves a little food, or even just general garden enthusiasts, it only makes perfect sense to begin building up healthy soil by making compost. Not only will this enhance fertility in the garden, but it\u2019ll also make good use of biodegradable trash. Instead of sending these things \u2014 food scraps, newspapers, documents, boxes, lawn trimmings, etc. \u2014 to the landfill, furthering a growing garbage problem, they can be used to make rich, healthy soil.\n7. Conserving Water\nIt\u2019s time we start doing our best to conserve our fresh water, and while turning off the faucet as we brush our teeth is a good thing, there are lots of good DIY projects that can save much more water. Water taps can be changed to more efficient versions. Toilet tanks can be adjusted to use less water. A lot of the kitchen graywater we create \u2014 washing vegetables, rinsing a glass, boiling pasta or potatoes \u2014 can be used to water houseplants or gardens. The ultimate DIY project would be to start converting graywater drainage into irrigation.\nA matter of a little initiative, idealism, and the DIY lifestyle can have a hugely positive impact on us, our communities, and the environment. Any of these pursuits are a worthy investment of time and effort, and the outcomes are something to be proud of. That\u2019s what everyone wants in the new year.\nLead Image Source: Pixabay",
    "question": "What are some of the benefits of adopting DIY habits according to the context?",
    "answer": "Adopting DIY habits can lead to savings, empowerment through knowledge and experience, ecological responsibility, healthier options, and personal satisfaction from accomplishing tasks. Specific DIY habits like growing and fermenting food, making toiletries and cleaning products at home, repurposing items, building soil, and conserving water can also have additional benefits such as improving health, reducing environmental impact, and saving money.",

    "context": "The Best Places to Get Deals As the Holidays Approach\nThere are few times throughout the year when it\u2019s good to be a shopper, with holidays like Labor Day and Thanksgiving being prime times for discounts. Thanksgiving has come and gone, and if you missed Black Friday, you still have a chance to save big, whether you\u2019re buying for a loved one or yourself. Be sure to check these sources for some big savings on everything from clothes to technology.\nOnline Retailers\nWho doesn\u2019t do a little consulting online before busting out their wallet? Indeed, the Internet is great for nearly every step of the shopping process, from making product comparisons to finding reviews to actually making purchases. And if you\u2019re on the lookout for a good deal, chances are that you\u2019ll find it most easily online. Amazon, of course, should be your first stopping point. While the company almost always has reasonable prices on its products, it\u2019s running a special holiday sale through the end of the year.\nThe Big Box Stores\nSay what you will about online shopping, there\u2019s at least one downside to making all your purchases through the web: you have to place a lot of trust in the product description and other reviewers\u2019 thoughts. While visiting big box stores may not be as convenient as opening up your laptop and clicking a button, you can at least see the product in person and get a feel for its size and quality. You might not find the same degree of deals that you would online, but you never know \u2013 there might just be a bargain you wouldn\u2019t find elsewhere.\nTicket Discounters\nThese days, more and more are asking Santa for gifts that can\u2019t come neatly wrapped and placed under the tree. Rather than hope for a material thing that will be out of fashion (or inoperable) within a few years, these folks are choosing to spend their time on experiences that are more in-the-moment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth checking with your local venues for any holiday discounts on tickets to upcoming entertainment. You could also take a look at Groupon, the online couponing service, to see if there\u2019s anything that would strike your loved ones\u2019 fancies.\nBuying Gently Used\nSure, there\u2019s nothing like that \u201cnew car smell,\u201d but there\u2019s also nothing wrong with saving a little money by buying gently used. You can find a cheaper version of every kind of product out there, from furniture to devices. While there may be a stigma against gifting something that\u2019s been used, oftentimes, you can\u2019t even tell the difference between something you bought new from Walmart and something you got secondhand off Craigslist. In fact, sometimes the only way the product\u2019s been used is that it was taken out of its box!\nEveryone\u2019s always looking for a deal, and while the last minute before the holidays isn\u2019t the most optimal time, there are still some good bargains out there. Remember that you aren\u2019t always going to find one right away. Sometimes, it takes a little work! That said, when you finally find that amazing discount, it\u2019ll all have been worth it.",
    "question": "What are some of the best places to get deals as the holidays approach?",
    "answer": "Some of the best places to get deals as the holidays approach include online retailers like Amazon, big box stores, ticket discounters like Groupon, and platforms for buying gently used items such as Craigslist.",

    "context": "Portland Mini Maker Faire\nI recently visited the Portland Mini Maker Faire with my family on Sunday, September 11, 2016. We had been to the Portland Mini Maker Faire in 2014 as well and it was a lot of fun. This one was equally inspiring for my maker spirit, and there were a lot of fun activities for my kids to do as well.\nIt was held on the grounds of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) right beside the Willamette River.\nVisitors entering the Faire-grounds were greeted by the fabulous vision of a steampunk R2-D2 pulling a stagecoach that oscillated like a bucking bronco. One person could ride inside the R2-D2 device as it rolled around. It looked like the stagecoach was offering rides to some visitors as well.\nAnd now, without further ado, let's enter together this photo blog together - the marvelous world of the Portland Mini Maker Faire. (Find out more about Maker Faires in your area at.)\nRobot Critters\nHomage to Babbage\nYou can almost hear the click-clack of turning cogs and gears inside these gorgeous steampunk computers, complete with real working keyboards and mice.\nSteampunk Hovercraft\nWith a leather air skirt, wooden hull, and gorgeous copper and brass adornments, the Nemotoad is part Captain Nemo and part amphibious vehicle. If only there had been a video of it in action!\nCompressed Air Vehicles\nThe presenter at this booth has chosen bicycles as a simple test vehicle for compressed air propulsion. If it works out, it may be possible to scale up to larger vehicles.\n3, 2, 1, Blast off!\nThis booth invited kids to make their own paper rockets. A team member pumped up the air pressure and the kids got to count down and push the button that launched their paper rocket high into the air. Some of them even reached the freeway overpass up above.\nGiant Drone\nRace your own CNC car\nThis booth by CNC Router Parts had a couple of CNC routers set up turning wood blanks into various styles of cars. The team members then helped kids color and decorate their cars and hammer on the plastic wheels with metal nail axels.\nAfter that they invited the kids over to the race track to watch them shoot down the ramp and past the finish line which recorded whose car came in first.\nMillenium Falcnc\nThis booth featured the Millenium Falcon and lots of other models, art, and trinkets all cut out with laser cutters.\nWhiteboard drawing robot\nGroovy Ride\nGoal!\nThe soccer robot was a great hit with the kids. It could stop and grab the ball, maneuver, spin in crazy circles, and spit the ball back out to an excited child. There were also robots that could shoot balls into holes in a tall tower structure.\nCamper Time\nAfter looking at these beautiful campers, you might be inspired to build your own!\nPegboard Marble Run\nWith a pegboard, some pipe insulation, and a few marbles, your kids can have hours of fun, as demonstrated by this marble run.\nPirates... ahem... Privateers, Ahoy!\nThese piratey cosplayers were serving up information about seafaring and cannons, as well as testing players perceptiveness with a shell game.\nHoney Makers\nBeekeepers from BeeThinking gave a talk on beekeeping as well as giving tastes of various kinds of honey. If you're in the Portland area you can sign up for classes on beekeeping.\nMake a difference with InStove\nThe Art of Maker Faire\nMetalwork\nThings weren't only high-tech at the Mini Maker Faire. There were also lots of booths presenting traditional arts and crafts, including blacksmithing and jewelry making.\nPottery\nThere was a pottery booth where kids were encouraged to try their hand at making their own vessels and sculptures.\nScribbling Machines\nThis booth let visitors construct their own scribbling bots. When put down on the provided paper, they began to create a kind of semi-random artwork. Check out the instruction pages and build your own!\nShoemaker\nMaking Machines\nVarious booths had their making machines on display, including CNC machines, 3D printers, and even the Sphere Bot which does a great job decorating eggs.\nOther Maker Projects\nOther maker projects from one makerspace included a water pump, a canoe, and terrain for tabletop RPG gaming.\nBifurcating Penny Mosaic\nThis machine uses a scanner to separate light from dark pennies. It then uses switches to send them down a bifurcating path to a series of columns below where they form monochrome pictures like Abraham Lincoln's iconic face.\nPerfect Ratio Guitar Fretting\nLots of applied mathematics to the science of music here, plus some beautiful craftsmanship. Check out the write-up of designing Just Intonation and Fretted Instruments.\nRobot Art\nZenpressions\nThese beautiful ceramic balls each have different patterns embossed on their surfaces. When you roll them around in the sand, you can create beautiful tracks and trails. They had a sand box set up for kids to use too. Check out Olander Earthworks for more info.\nLED Throwies\nThis booth was set up to let kids make their own LED throwies, or LED badges that they could wear on their shirts. It's a fun activity for the kids to see that they can make a basic electronic gadget with a colorful LED, a button battery, and a magnet.\nSpare Parts Store\nSome people were selling their creations, and there was this store selling surplus parts, with some examples of what you can create.\nGeometric Building Kit\nAncestral Technologies\nTrackers, Anvil Academy, and a few other groups were demonstrating ancestral technologies such as archery, firemaking, foraging, blacksmithing, barrel making, and so on.\nCardboard Costumes\nThis booth let visitors create their own costumes and props out of cardboard, as well as exhibiting some of their master-craft creation.\nVelcro LED Throwie Wall\nThis giant black fabric wall was covered with LED throwies. Instead of the normal magnet, these had velcro attached. Visitors could arrange them in patterns to make pictures and words, as well as stand back and toss them for target practice.\nTwisty Tubes and Tunnels\nThe Portland Children's Museum set up this space where visitors could construct their own ball tunnel contraptions and then run wooden balls and ping pong balls down through them. Loads of fun for the kids.\nFaire Well!\nWe spent about 3 hours at the Mini Maker Faire and had a great time with a 5-year-old, 3-year-old, and 5-week-old in tow. The older kids had a great time with all the activities and we adults marveled at people's creativity and the beautiful things they'd made.\nI highly recommend checking out a Maker Faire or Makerspace in your area. Get inspired and get making!",

    "context": "TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. retailers looking north in their quest for growth should consider the frosty reception Canada has so far given trendy discounter Target Corp a cautionary tale: what looks like a simple border crossing can easily go wrong.\nOn the surface, Canada seems a good bet for retailers tiptoeing outside the United States, with Nordstrom and Saks among those now lined up to test the market. But winning over Canadians is no cake walk, and name recognition alone won\u2019t do the trick.\n\u201cThe bottom line has to be the price,\u201d said Peter Tong, a 38-year-old transit system designer who spends many lunch hours browsing at the Eaton Center mall in downtown Toronto, where a good number of U.S.-based retailers are located.\nThe Black Friday sales there were \u201chyped up,\u201d he said. At the JCrew store, a C$260 ($240) cashmere sweater is 30 percent off, but a quick check on Tong\u2019s iPhone shows it sells for $200 at JCrew in the United States, with the same discount. \u201cWhy are we paying C$60 - and 13 percent taxes - on top?\u201d\nRetailers underestimate the importance of pricing in Canada at their peril, and Target\u2019s experiences are a case in point..\nAdmitting it has had problems in its first international expansion, Target last month cut its full-year profit forecast, due largely to lower-than-expected sales in Canada.\n\u201cTarget had one thing that they had to accomplish...make the first shopping experience for every Canadian a positive one, and unfortunately, they failed at that,\u201d said James Smerdon, vice president and director of retail consulting at Colliers International Consulting.\nThe allure of Canada for U.S. retailers is that it is a market with fewer shopping centers than in the United States, less intense competition and relatively high sales volume.\nThe Eaton Center and the Yorkdale Shopping Center, both in Toronto, for instance, boast North American-leading sales of around C$1,300 per square foot.\n\u201cPart of the strength of U.S. retailers that are coming to Canada is that there is brand recognition,\u201d said Yorkdale general manager Anthony Casalanguida. \u201cThere exists that pent-up demand because of the fact that Canadian shoppers know what these retailers are all about.\u201d\nYorkdale is already home to such high-end retailers as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co, and Casalanguida advises new arrivals to consider their pricing carefully because Canadians are keen comparison shoppers.\nHe said many U.S. retailers at the mall, including Ann Taylor and White House/Black Market, are matching U.S. prices. That may cut into margins, but it stokes sales.\nAn estimated three-quarters of Canadians live just 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the U.S. border. Cross-border shopping and new relaxed duty-free rules create brand familiarity and high expectations.\nThe next wave of U.S. newcomers will be led by luxury retailer Nordstrom Inc, whose Canadian president, Karen McKibbin, acknowledges some prices will have to be higher in Canada due to taxes and duties. She says Nordstrom will try to minimize such cases and won\u2019t be a \u201cNordstrom-lite\u201d that will disappoint shoppers.\nNordstrom will open the first of five Canadian stores next year, and may open 15 to 20 lower-cost Rack outlets.\nIt will have company in upscale chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which was bought by Canada\u2019s oldest retailer, Hudson\u2019s Bay Co, this summer for $2.9 billion. Up to seven full-line Canadian Saks stores and two dozen Off 5th outlets are planned.\nTarget still expects its Canadian operations to bring in 10 percent of its profits by 2017. What it didn\u2019t expect was the rocky start. Experts say it wanted too much, too quickly, from Canada, while underestimating domestic competition.\n\u201cIf they (Target) had set the bar lower, then we would not be having this conversation,\u201d said Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer.\n($1=$1.065 Canadian)\nEditing by Peter Galloway",

Both KKR and SRH have done well in patches and both of them will fight it out to grab a spot in the Qualifier 2 at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium.\nGautam Gambhir won the toss and chose to field as they the KKR team had done consistently well while chasing. Shikhar Dhawan fell early and then it was the partnership between Warner and Henriques that set the platform for the middle order batsmen to play their game. Yuvraj Singh played an important inning of 44 runs in 30 balls to ensure that SRH posted a good total.

    "context": "almonds, honey, pastry, pistachios\nI\u2019m still writing up this week\u2019s Sunday baking recipe, but as an appetizer, I\u2019m putting up the baklava I made in the middle of last week.\nAnd why did the crazy woman make baklava in the middle of the week? Because she can, darlings!\nOK, truthfully, because she defrosted phyllo over the Fourth of July weekend, dreaming all kinds of big phyllo-wrapped dreams, but never actually got around to realizing any of them. Instead, I made a simple spinach, potato and feta pie for dinner on Tuesday, using one of the two individually-wrapped 8-oz sleeves in the pack. Then, looking down at the third of a roll of dough left in the sleeve, I thought, what the hell, I\u2019ll make baklava while I\u2019m at it.\nAlthough I have a few legitimate Greek cookbooks, I chose the Cook\u2019s Illustrated Best International Recipe version as a starting point because I had yet to cook out of that book despite having obtained it it nearly two years ago as a result of the temporary insanity that led me to sign up for the CI cookbook club.\nIn addition to roughly quartering the quantities to fit the amount of dough I had, I made a couple of modifications in terms of ingredients and technique. First, regardless of its supposed superiority over plain melting, there was no way I was clarifying butter at 9:00 pm on a work day. I also chose the more adventurous combination of almonds and pistachios over their walnut-almond mix.\nThe combination of almonds and pistachios worked well, because pistachios alone can be a little overwhelming in baklava, and almonds by themselves don\u2019t have enough character to stand up to the honey syrup. The CI approach of creating three thin layers of nut filling produces a nicely flaky and cohesive pastry without the usual tendency to slide and split in half when picked up. It was nicely saturated all the way through with this quantity of syrup, but next time I might double it just to ensure a completely hedonistic experience.\nBaklava is never going to be an effortless endeavor, but this was ready to bake by the time the spinach pie came out of the oven, and it makes a perfectly reasonable quantity for a small household instead of enough to feed an army. It does need to sit several hours to absorb the syrup, so you won\u2019t be eating it until morning unless you\u2019re an even more incorrigible night owl than I am. The reward for your evening industriousness is sticky, buttery, crisp, perfect baklava with your breakfast coffee.\nAlmond-Pistachio Baklava\nServes 2-6\nSyrup:\n5 tablespoons granulated sugar\n3 tablespoons honey\n2 strips lemon zest\n1-inch piece of cinnamon stick\n2 cloves\n1 pinch salt\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\nPastry:\n2 ounces sliced, unsalted almonds\n1 ounce roasted, salted pistachios\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\nGenerous pinch of ground cloves\n1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar\n1 stick unsalted butter, melted\n1/4 lb phyllo sheets\nCombine sugar, honey, zest, and spices for the syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat until sugar has dissolved, stirring or swirling the pot as necessary. Transfer to a heat-safe cup, remove the lemon peel and cinnamon stick, stir in the lemon juice, and set aside to cool.\nAdjust oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 300 F. Liberally butter the bottom and sides of a glass baking dish approximately 8 x 6 x 2.\nProcess nuts in a food processor until finely chopped, and transfer to a small bowl. Remove 1 tablespoon of nut mixture for the final garnish, then add cinnamon, cloves, and 1/2 tablespoon of sugar to remaining nuts.\nUnroll the phyllo and cut to fit the size of the pan. Place one sheet in the bottom of the pan, and brush the entire surface with melted butter. Repeat with 9 more sheets, then sprinkle the top with one third of the nut filling. Cover the filling with 6 more individually-buttered sheets, and the next third of the filling. Repeat with another 6 sheets and the final third of nut mixture. Top with 8-10 more sheets of phyllo.\nUsing your flat palms, press out any air bubbles in the pastry, then brush on the remaining butter. Using a serrated knife, cut the baklava into diamonds, making sure to pierce all the way through the bottom layers.\nBake 1 1/2 hours or until completely golden, rotating the pan halfway through. Remove from oven and immediately pour all but 2 tablespoons of the syrup along each crevice, then drizzle the remaining syrup over the top. Sprinkle a generous pinch of the reserved ground nuts on the center of each piece.\nCool on a wire rack for 2-3 hours, then cover with foil and let stand 8 hours or overnight.\nPingback: Flantastico! \u00ab Lady Disdain",

    "context": "For twenty years we lived on the west coast of Wales in a country bungalow. One of the things I missed most when we moved to the city was the wide variety of wildlife, which entertained us in our large garden.\nThere were many different birds, from the tiny wren living in the rockery, to the red kites who gave us a daily aerobatic show as they whirled, dived and glided over the field next door.\nJW bought sacks of wild bird food every Autumn and made feeding tables complete with food hoppers, which he fixed in the trees around the house. The birds were used to him refilling these every morning and waited around quite patiently for him to go out. We were amused to see where the saying \u201cpecking order\u201d came from, as they waited patiently for their turns to visit the tables.\nInevitably some of the food fell off the tables and we did get a few strange crops under them! After a short time the pheasants from a neighbouring farmer found the food and eventually they became regular visitors and some even started roosting in our trees, and as soon as JW went into the barn to get their food, they would come running from all corners of the garden.\nOf course we don\u2019t see such a large variety of birds now, but a week or two ago we noticed that we had not seen any birds, so he went off and bought bird food and filled the hopper on our one table.

    "context": "I\u2019m halfway through reading this brilliant book that a lot of people will have heard of, or read. It is Jean-Dominique Bauby\u2019s The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\nOn the front of the book there is a quote from the Financial Times calling it \u201cone of the greatest books of the century\u201d. I\u2019m inclined to agree. It is probably the most inspiring book I have ever read.\nWhy is it brilliant? Because the author found himself locked inside a body that no longer worked. The only thing he had left was his mind and one eye, which still functioned. The other eye had been sewn shut in the hospital and his body was paralysed. I tried to imagine the overwhelming fear and horror at waking up to find yourself in this position. But I can\u2019t. Could anyone imagine this? How would you cope? It is unimaginable.\nJean-Dominique was an editor, a man of words, and had two children. Then he suffered a stroke. He was about the same age as me. The title of the book comes from his idea that his existence in this new body, which no longer worked and was a constant source of pain, felt like being inside a diving bell. When reading the book I imagined his mind as the butterfly, which could fly free, leaving his now lifeless body behind.\nAnd his mind really flies free. His existence becomes one created from his memories and what he can view through one eye in a hospital room. The condition of Locked-In Syndrome is more understood now, and Jean-Dominique set up a foundation for it in 1996. Back then, it was more of a mystery. The thing that stood out for me was his hope. It\u2019s not a book filled with self-pity or self-loathing, but hope. This and the indominable strength of the mind. How would we cope if the only thing we had left was our mind? The strongest part of the body perhaps. With it, I like to think, we can do anything. Or at least, we can dream that we can do anything. We live in a world in which most things are possible. We can dream to dream that we can achieve our dreams. The power of the mind.\nI also started thinking about the prisons that we can find themselves in. This lack of freedom that we do not choose, but we are stuck in, and then how do we cope? What do we do? And the power of positive thinking, which we can lose at times, which can drift off; sometimes we don\u2019t even notice it leaving.\nI read this week of the release of Weiwei. A free thinker and artist who, in our \u2018modern world\u2019, lives in one of the countries without freedom of expression, human rights or freedom of information. He was imprisoned because his beliefs are against those of China\u2019s oppressive government. A man with the power of mind to stand up for his beliefs and try to achieve the freedom that many of us take for granted. He has been released, but at what cost to him? At the moment he can make no comment. Thus he is still living in an invisible prison and I will watch with interest what happens next. I wish him all the best.\nThen there are the prisons that each of us may find ourselves in at any time of our lives. The bars that come up that prevent us doing what we want to do. Whether this is a government removing our freedom of expression or the removal of our human rights. Whether it is debt, which prevents us living how we would like to live. Similarly, lack of money, which stops us doing things. Or perhaps it is lack of confidence to do something. Or perhaps it is a physical illness that strikes us and suddenly we are not the same, or we think we are not the same as we find we cannot do easily what we once did before. Recently I\u2019ve been inspired by a couple of writers, who have debilitating illnesses, but they are writing and doing their best to carry on as normal. And then there are the non-physical illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, which I have been dealing with for the past year, as have many other people. Although not a physical illness, it builds up and affects your ability to function, to enjoy the big things and the small things, colouring everything black and seeing negativity in everything; in the end it can result in a physical illness. And so the circle goes on.\nAll of these things can prevent us from doing things, achieving things. They can leave us thinking we are at the bottom of a hole with no way of climbing out. I visited an exhibition recently for the organisation MIND, which my friend, Gema Newby, helped to organise, and some of the artists/writers had come up with the idea of a well. That we all have this well inside of us. A negative thing that builds up, can overwhelm us, and the task of climbing out can become harder. On the outside, our clamber up can be made easier by hope, friends, family, therapists and interests, or goals, or even a pet. But for the person inside the well the climb seems like a Mount Everest to surmount. Sometimes the people on the outside will understand; sometimes they won\u2019t.\nReading The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly I\u2019m reminded how the smallest things should give us joy. Today is a sunny day and I\u2019m intending to go out soon to the forest. The smallest things \u2013 the feel of the sun, the air on your face, walking under leaves where everything smells green, the chatter of birds. All these things. Everyone has the right to joy, to be happy. These things can be taken away so easily, which is why it is so important to make the most of everything, and I\u2019m pretty guilty of not doing this lately. These simple things, which, really, are huge things - the essence of life.\nAnd so I come back to the power of the mind. The power of the mind to surmount difficulties. The power of our minds to help ourselves. Yes the mind can also trick us at times, or lock us into negative thought patterns and inaction. But mainly it has the power to ride out the difficulties around us. I\u2019m amazed when I read about the strength of people. All of us have problems, large or small. All of us know of other people \u2013 it may be ourselves \u2013 who have overcome or are dealing with massive problems. We all have the power to unlock the prisons inside our minds. Or to ask for help. The expression of free thought being one of our dearest things.\nIn the case of Jean-Dominique Dauby, it was a speech therapist called Sandrine who finally gave him a way of reconnecting with the outside world and his family and friends. She gave him the power to communicate, so he could release his thoughts, which had been his only companions for so long, and the butterfly could fly free.\nThanks for commenting - have a kitty cool day! :)",

To my mind, it was all rather dull with a simple recitative used throughout instead of any chance at lyricism (which I would have thought the book would encourage). I've never been so relieved to see the descent of a curtain. Though the singers were grand, I have to say, and of course it's always good to see a red-haired woman as the main character, naturally - it's just that the material they had to work with seemed poor. As Lord H commented as we left, they took the best bits of a very difficult book, so good on the lyricist and composer for that - but what they should have done to convey the power and passion of the themes was to give the South American flavour by using the rhythms and songs of that country, and to contrast this with the Catholicism sections by using religious chant as a counterpoint.

Yes it does.\nMac Studio Fix Powder Foundation.\nI am not a fan of Mac's liquid foundations, but the Studio Fix Powder Foundation is awesome if you need coverage and have combo or oily skin. This is great and I used it for years. Mac also have a \"back to Mac\" policy whereby if u return any six empty Mac containers (powder compacts, eyeshadow pots etc ) you will get a free lipstick. I absolutely love Mac lipstick. So getting a free lipstick of your choice was a bonus (excluding the Viva Glam collection). When I started using this foundation I did not have primer and setting sprays, so with these two products it will look even better and natural with no powdery finish. I wear the shade NC30 in winter and NC35 in summer. I also think this foundation is reasonably priced. Mac has a setting spray called \"Mac Fix Plus\" setting spray which is very popular but expensive, which can also be used to set this foundation if required.\nPalladio Herbal Dual Wet n Dry Powder Foundation\nSo from the description is says that you can apply it wet or dry.\nUSE DRY FOR A SHEER NATURAL LOOK. I would personally use a Kabuki brush and only use the sponge included for on the go touch ups if I didn't want to carry an extra brush.\nUSE WET FOR MAXIMUM COVERAGE. The instructions on the box states : Wet sponge with water for oily skin or your favourite moisturiser for dry skin and apply for all day maximum coverage. I have not tried this method. Instead I take my Kabuki brush and swirl it in the powder., Then I spray the Kabuki brush with distilled water, then I apply it to my face. This method applies lovely without wetting the powder compact itself. You then swirl the brush back into the compact for more product and spray the Kabuki brush again and apply yo the other side of your face. Using this method gives me good coverage and I don't get the powdery look and it looks like satin on my skin. You can then leave the foundation as it is or set it with a setting spray.\nIf you have normal skin you might not need a setting spray since it was already applied with water which blended nicely into your skin already.\nThe only downside to this foundation is that's it has 8g of product and gets finished quickly.\nThe storage compartment for the sponge is bigger than it needs to be. But for the price, you can afford to repurchase as it does cost less and works better than most high end brands.\nEstee Lauder Double Wear stay in place powder foundation\nOther powder foundations I have tried include Clinique powder foundation and Kanebo powder foundation. I was colour matched incorrectly for the both these powder foundations so I gave them to a friend to use. The Kanebo powder foundation was awesome! Its a pity I was colour matched incorrectly. Besides being a gorgeous foundation, it comes in a refill container so you purchase the container once-off and only purchase the refill thereafter. The only reason I did not repurchase was because it is quite expensive. Also the packaging is really smart. Kanebo is sold at Dischem stores.\nApplying powder foundation:\nI once watched a You tube video where the instructor sprayed Mac's Fix Plus setting spray onto her face, then swirled her brush into the powder compact, then sprayed the brush with the powder on it. She then applied this all over her face. She finished off by setting her face / foundation with another spray of the Mac Fix Plus. This method gave her thecoverage she needed, made the powder adhere to the skin and took away that powdery look.\nI decided to try this method but tweaked the application a little. The item I used where:\n- Primer\n- Kabuki brush\n- Distilled or bottled water in a spray bottle\n- Rosewater / Vitamin E spray / Mac Fix Plus Setting Spray.\nAll primers are different so use one that agrees with your skin.\nI always use a kabuki brush to apply powder foundation. It gives more control and a precise application and more coverage when applied.\nI always have a spray bottle with distilled or bottled water in it. After I swirl the powder in the compact I spray the kabuki brush with water, thereby dampening the powder, and then apply it to my skin. I continue with this until my entire face is covered in powder foundation.\nI then choose whether I want to set the powder foundation further before applying blush although it is not necessary.\nI would then spritz more distilled water over my face which just sets the powder and blends it into my skin. This is good for oily skin as you are not applying any foreign ingredients to your skin that may make you oily throughout the day.\nI may choose to set the foundation with rosewater (without any glycerin) instead\nOn the days my skin is feeling dry, I set it with the Vitamin E spray I purchased form the Body Shop..\nYour powder foundation will wear for a longer period without having to reapply.\nThanks for reading.\nXoxo",

As announced at the launch, the intention is a biennial festival, each time tackling a different type of identity: for 2010, it\u2019s the thorny question of English identity.\nOver the next three days (Fri 26th \u2013 Sun 28th) they\u2019re screening some of the greatest and/or more intriguing English movies ever made, from classics like Olivier\u2019s Henry V and Get Carter, to modern hits like Control and Made in Dagenham, both of the latter including Q&As with their respective screenwriters. A side-project, \u2018England From Above,\u2019 tackles some of the many great English movies directed by foreigners, including Repulsion, Blow Up and Children of Men, the latter of which I\u2019m introducing on Sunday night so please come along to that, at least!\nThings kicked off last night with a panel discussion that brought together professors, film archivists and a bona fide English acting legend in David Morrissey. Put five people, plus a moderator, next to each other, and you\u2019re never going to get any concrete answers about what it means to be English, but instead we got a suitably thought-provoking, freeform discussion about all aspects of national identity. There was enough food for thought to keep one feasting for months, with the panel demonstratig a refreshing humour, insight and candour throughout.\nSubjects included (amongst other things) regional accents, racism, WW2 movies, whether the \u201cEnglish\u201d are distinct from the \u201cBritish,\u201d and whether commercial movies can ever cope to represent the complexity of national life as well as television, theatre or literature.\nThis latter aspect provoked the only misstep of the night, as some idiot in the audience asked whether the remaking of English classics (specifically Morrissey\u2019s TV classics Blackpool, State of Play and Red Riding) diluted English identity by using \u201cmore marketable actors.\u201d Morrissey, with instinctive Scouse wit, quipped back, \u201cOh, ta very much for that,\u201d and showed up the guy in the audience for the complete tool that he was for being so bloody stupid.\nI\u2019m not saying who that person was\u2026 but you can read between the lines, right? Suffice to say, he\u2019s suitably ashamed of himself.\nApart from that, the evening was a resounding success, and in a strange way made me feel proud of being \u2018English,\u2019 without all those horrible far-right connotations getting in the way. Things culminated in a screening of The Third Man, the \u201cgreatest British movie of all time\u201d (as voted by the BFI, anyway..). A proper review of that will appear here in due course.\nIn the meantime, get yourself down to Derby and enjoy some of England\u2019s (or Britain\u2019s, or wherever\u2019s) greatest movies.\nRelated posts\nTagged Derby QUAD, Festivals, ID Fest\nChristine KilbyNov 27, 2010 at 3:07 pm\nI thoroughly enjoyed most of the evening. Your remark along the lines of 'high profile' actors going on to replace original cast members must, on reflection, have made you cringe! I felt Professor Cecile Wright looked very uncomfortable and in my opinion was the poorest contributor who did herself no favours by politicising every topic covered.

Box 18300\nGreensboro, NC 27419\nDear Mr. Harrison:\nRe: Registration of a Major Change in Use for Fludioxonil Contained in Medallion M Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 100-769)\nNovartis Crop Protection, Inc. submitted an application and supporting documentation on March 27, 1997 for the registration of Medallion Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 100-769), containing the active ingredient fludioxonil, for use to control certain foliar and soil-borne diseases in ornamental plants grown in containers, greenhouses and other enclosed structures.\nFludioxonil\nis currently registered in New York State in the pesticide product Maxim 4FS (EPA Reg. No. 100-758) for use as a seed treatment to control certain fungal diseases in field and sweet corn, popcorn and sorghum. The Department determined that the proposed use of Medallion on ornamentals in enclosed structures represents a major change in label for fludioxonil.\nMedallion is a protectant fungicide containing 50% fludioxonil [4-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzdioxol-4-yl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, a pyrrolnitrin derivative] which can be applied through irrigation and by either soil drench or foliar spray methods. Medallion controls damping-off and root and stem rot disease caused by Rhizoctonia spp. Medallion may be used as a soil drench on ornamentals at the time of seeding or transplanting, or on established plants. Medallion is also used as a foliar spray for control of Botrytis spp., foliar Rhizoctonia spp., and Alternaria spp. on ornamentals. Medallion is mixed at the rate of one eight-ounce packet per 100 gal. water and is applied at the rate of up to one pt/sq. ft using one application for seedlings. Medallion is used on transplants and cuttings using two to four eight-ounce packets/100 gal. of water. This application may be repeated in 21-28 days if needed. Medallion is mixed at the rate of 4-16 packets/100 gal. of water when used as a foliar spray and this application may be repeated at 7-14 day intervals.\nThe Department has completed its review of the subject product. The findings and conclusions are discussed below, broken down by Ecological, Human Health and Groundwater impacts.\nEcological Effects:\nMinimal exposure to fish and wildlife is expected from the use of fludioxonil in greenhouses and other enclosed structures.\nHuman Health Effects:\nWhile fludioxonil has been previously evaluated as to human health effects, the Medallion registration package contained some additional toxicity information as well as acute toxicity data for the Medallion product. The acute toxicity data for Medallion indicate that it is not very toxic, irritating or a sensitizer.\nIt has been noted that fludioxonil caused an increased incidence of heptacellular tumors in female rats and a positive dose-related trend for total lymphomas in females in one mouse oncogenicity study. A second study in mice, which included higher dose levels, did not report an increased tumor incidence in either sex. At the time of the first review, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) had not yet classified fludioxonil as to its oncogenic potential, and the USEPA Registration Eligibility Decision document states that no additional uses (other than seed treatment) of this compound should be registered until the Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee has evaluated the carcinogenicity data. The Committee has now classified fludioxonil as a Group D (not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity) compound.\nThe USEPA estimated exposure and risks to mixer/loader/applicators of medallion from soil drench treatment and foliar spray treatment were estimated to be 0.2995 milligrams/kilogram body weight/day (mg/kg/day) and 0.0477 mg/kg/day, respectively. Medallion can be applied repeatedly at certain intervals, but chronic daily use by workers is not expected. To evaluate worker risks, the USEPA compared estimated exposures to a no-observed-effects level (NOEL) from an oral subchronic dog study (50 mg/kg/day) and calculated margins of exposure of 167 and 1,048 for soil drench and foliar spray treatments, respectively. In a rat developmental toxicity study, an increased incidence of dilated renal, pelvis and ureter in offspring was reported at a dose level of 1,000 mg/kg/day, with a NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day. Margins of exposure for soil drench and foliar spray are 334 and 2,096, respectively, based on comparison of exposure estimates to this NOEL.\nMedallion is labeled for use on ornamental plants grown in containers, greenhouses and other enclosed structures. Given this use, exposure of the general public to fludioxonil from Medallion use should be minimal. In addition, risk estimates for workers handling Medallion are at levels generally accepted as adequate for occupational exposures.\nGroundwater Impacts:\nThe Department did not review this indoor use as they had previously reviewed fludioxonil for outdoor use as a seed treatment and had no objection to its registration.\nRegistration Action:\nTherefore, based on the above reviews, the Department accepts for registration in New York State the pesticide product Medallion Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 100-769) for use as federally/D. Luttinger, NYS Dept. of Health",

    "context": "The budget scandal now engulfing New York\u2019s City Council, in which staffers have allocated money to fictitious groups and two workers have been charged with bilking taxpayers out of some $145,000, is just the latest in a long line of controversies involving city funding of nonprofits. These scandals periodically emerge because in today\u2019s political landscape, elected officials use money designated for nonprofits to buy and keep political influence. Not surprisingly, then, they do everything they can to keep this money free from oversight.\nNearly 15 years ago, the city\u2019s Financial Control Board identified the growing problem when it released a blistering report on the city\u2019s contracting of services from nonprofits. The report pointed out that New York was failing to keep accurate records of its dealings with these organizations and doing little to ensure that nonprofits receiving city dollars fulfilled their contractual obligations. In many cases, the city government awarded contracts without competitive bidding, and it rarely evaluated the nonprofits\u2019 performance.\nIn the wake of the report, city agencies reformed some of their contracting practices. But City Council members managed to keep a big pot of money safe from the new, stricter contracting requirements. This money, reserved for so-called \u201cmember items\u201d (a euphemism in many cases for pork-barrel spending) and for so-called council \u201cinitiatives\u201d (discretionary spending that the speaker doles out), has been at the center of various funding controversies in the past.\nThe underlying problem is the central role that nonprofits now play in politics, which has been shaped by the huge pots of money that government steers their way. Decades ago, nonprofits were known by their old-fashioned name: charities. They derived most of their income from private donations and based their agendas on the needs of those they wished to serve. Then the Johnson administration\u2019s War on Poverty, begun in the mid-1960s, turned the charities into government agents who would run programs designed to help the poor. The feds allocated billions of dollars to nonprofits through direct grants or via money funneled through state and local government agencies. In the process, the federal government paid nonprofits to do everything from running homeless shelters and rehabilitation programs for drug addicts to opening job training centers and designing and operating preschool programs. In just a few years, the money turned many charities into government contractors, reliant on public funding and serving an agenda set by Washington or local governments. The sudden availability of so much government money also prompted enterprising individuals to get into the public-contracting game and create new nonprofits of their own.\nThe subsequent growth of the nonprofit sector has been considerable. In 1975, about 52,000 jobs in New York City were devoted to private social services. Today, though the city\u2019s population has increased only slightly since the mid-1970s, social-services jobs number more than 160,000, making them one of the fastest-growing sectors. Indeed, private social services now rival Wall Street as one of Gotham\u2019s biggest employers; three times as many people work in private social agencies as in publishing. But while these service jobs are counted as part of the private sector, they\u2019re financed almost entirely with government money. The industry continues to rely for its growth on expanding government budgets, fueled by tax collections.\nFurther, many nonprofits have become political power bases, replacing the local political clubhouses of the 1960s. Executives and founders of nonprofits have used their agencies as launching pads for political careers, so that today a job in the nonprofit sector is as likely a route to the City Council or the state legislature as being a lawyer and member of a local political machine once was. And channeling money into nonprofit groups is a sure way for a legislator to win friends and influence people.\nTo do that, of course, legislators have to be free to contribute to groups they favor\u2014and that means ensuring that taxpayers\u2019 money is not subject to rigorous bidding procedures, which might exclude the favored groups. Three years ago, for instance, councilwoman Margarita Lopez sparked controversy when she gave hundreds of thousands of her member-item dollars to a detoxification program for 9/11 workers that was run by Scientologists and that, experts claimed, had no basis in legitimate science. Lopez had made the grants using council funds that carried no requirement for competitive bidding or evaluation of program effectiveness. Eventually, members of the church made more than $100,000 in donations to her campaign for Manhattan borough president.\nWhen oversight is so thin, bad things can happen to taxpayers\u2019 money. In the latest scandals, two council staffers face indictments for allegedly embezzling money channeled into a nonprofit that one of them created and controlled. New Yorkers have also learned that for at least seven years, City Council staffers have created phony nonprofit groups and allocated money to them as a way of parking cash that could be dispensed later.\nBecause of the powerful role that nonprofits now play in the political process, council members are resisting new efforts to regulate their discretionary giving. They\u2019ve opposed Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s call to move all but the very smallest council grants\u2014those of $10,000 or less\u2014into the city\u2019s competitive-bidding process. Council members claim that ceding that control to the mayor threatens their \u201cindependence.\u201d Experience tells us, however, that allowing the council to continue its broad discretionary use of public money threatens something else\u2014the fiscal integrity of New York\u2019s budget process. Taxpayers deserve better.",

    "context": "Cat Deshedding Tool Review: The EquiGroomer\nI was introduced to the EquiGroomer when the inventor reached out to me via e-mail, introducing her product. Since it was first invented for horses (the EquiGroomer for horses is much bigger than the cat-sized ones that we received for review), I reached out to a few of my friends who are savvy in the horse world to ask what they thought of it. I do a lot of \u201cpreliminary\u201d stuff like that before I accept a product for review, so that I can be sure that I can actually do a review (I do not like to post bad reviews, therefore, I try to be sure about whether or not a product might work before it arrives).\nAs you might have guessed, I got a positive response from the \u201chorse-people\u201d I know, so I asked that three of the EquiGroomer shedding blades be sent to us \u2013 one for my parents\u2019 house, one for my house and one for my sister\u2019s house.\nWhat is the EquiGroomer?\nThe EquiGroomer is a very simple cat grooming tool that is basically a piece of wood that has what-looks-like a saw blade on the other side. It\u2019s very sturdy and easy to hold.\nAs you can see in our review video below, it takes a little practice to the hang of how to use it, but it does do a great job as a deshedding tool for cats. I love it more than brushes like Furminator, because the EquiGroomer removes the dead coat underneath- rather than cutting the healthy, shiny coat above.\nThe EquiGroomer\u2019s blade\u2019s teeth grab loose hair by the ends so there\u2019s no pulling, discomfort or damage to the skin or coat. That\u2019s probably why my cats, Charlie and Trigg, who hate being groomed, tolerated the EquiGroomer more than they have other brushes we have reviewed.\nOutside\nI definitely recommend using the EquiGroomer outside \u2013 as fur can fly everywhere, especially until you can get the hang of how to use it so that fur doesn\u2019t fly everywhere. In fact, my sister didn\u2019t end up using it too much because she doesn\u2019t let her cats outside and had no where to brush them without the hair flying.\nAs you can see in our final review video below, when the blade fills with hair, you can simply pull it off with one swipe.\nOverall, I really like the EquiGroomer and will definitely keep it in our cat grooming tool box . It does an awesome job at deshedding and getting rid of the loose hair and dander. I was probably most impressed by it\u2019s ability to not piss off Charlie and Trigg \u2013 a hard task for any cat grooming tool.\nEquiGroomer Product Unboxing and Arrival Video\nEquiGroomer Product Review Video\nEquiGroomer Cat Deshedding Tool Colors\nThe EquiGroomer comes in a number of different fun colors:\nBuy the EquiGroomer\nWe received the EquiGroomers for review from the manufacturer .

You\u2019re actually just thinning his coat here. Even with very gentle pressure these can still break or pull at the Ragdolls coat. I personally prefer a good slicker brush to remove any loose coat, a pin brush to add volume and shine, metal comb to finish. You can use other combs and brushes too if your grooming for show and some Ragdolls do better with different bristle types depending on each cats individual coat.\u201d\nSo I messed up by saying, \u201cundercoat\u201d \u2013 but rather it thins the coat!

Farrell\nWhen I was a little boy, we lived in a small bungalow on the waterfront, in a quaint little community of bungalows atmospherically alive with wandering alcoholics, flea-scratching dogs and spraying tomcats. My mom grew up there. My dad discovered and fell in love with it, finding it far superior to the Harlem railroad flats of his youth. They married at the time Hitler was perfecting his blitzkrieg. I arrived at the peak of the F\u00fchrer\u2019s success.\nThe war in Europe scooped up my father and took him out of our life while he was still just a blur to me. He was gone for two years and returned as a large, semi-stranger from a far-off land whose presence filled the bungalow and wedged uncomfortably between my mom and me.\nSpitting distance from our house was a little brown-sand beach. In the summer time, if the tide was high and the day warm, I went swimming with Mom and Dad in the tepid and semi-polluted saltwater. After splashing around in the languid seaweed, baking under the hot sun, we all went back into the little house and showered to rid ourselves of the salt and god knows what else. The house had a cubicle of a bathroom, subway-tiled walls, tiny hex-tiled floor, a toilet, sink and, of course, an enamelled, iron bathtub, which was to play a major role in my young life.\nI loved my mom. She was very beautiful. Even as a toddler I knew this as I hugged my arm \u2018round her leg, rested my cheek against her smooth thigh and looked upward at the delightful rest of her. After swimming, she took me into the shower with her and rinsed me off. I loved it\u2014the intimacy of our bathing together, the warm water, my wonderful young mom with the golden blond hair standing over me naked. I watched her rinsing the salt from her hair, the water flowing over the pure white skin, which her bathing suit hid from the sun and the calm tan the sun\u2019s rays had lavished upon her glistening legs. Her sweet image mesmerized me. It was a period of calm life, a good time for a sprout to grow.\nThere it is. A memory. An artefact to hoard and cherish. Not to be launched into the attic dust but carefully stored within the mind as experience. We all hoard experiences. You really cannot throw them away, even if desperate to do so.

    "context": "Many players face a devastating choice: Should you serve with lots of spin, with the serve going long and allowing the opponent to loop, or should you sacrifice spin, even serving with no spin, so you can keep the serve short? Actually, you can do both. In fact, the spinnier the serve, the easier it is to keep short.\nNearly every coach will tell you to first learn to serve with great spin. Holding back on the spin so you can serve short is a good way to develop a bad habit. When you can get great spin on the ball, then you learn to serve short - but this happens automatically. To get maximum spin, you need to whip the racket into the ball at full speed (using the arm to get the playing hand moving, and snapping the wrist into the ball just before contact) but barely graze the ball. Nearly all of the energy from your arm and wrist goes into spin. When that happens, the ball barely comes off the racket - and so it is easy to keep the ball short. Those who have difficulty serving short with spin are having trouble mostly because they are not grazing the ball finely enough - and so the solution isn't to serve with less spin; it's to serve with more spin by grazing the ball more.\nThe other reason a spinny serve might go long is the contact point is too high, which also leads to the serve being too high. Once you are grazing the ball very finely, you need to learn to serve it low with a low contact point, and learn where to bounce it on each side of the table for varying depths. If you barely graze the ball, you'll not only maximize the spin but since nearly all your energy is going into spin, you'll find yourself almost struggling to get the ball to reach and go over the net - which is a good thing. It means the serve will be short and spinny.\nThe ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible. Sometimes a super-short serve is effective (which might bounce three or more times on the opponent's side, given the chance), as it forces the opponent to reach well over the table, but super-short serves are also easier to flip, push short, or quick-push at an angle. Many players use \"tweeny\" serves, where the second bounce is right around the endline, and the receiver is never quite sure if it will come off the end or not.\nOnce you have a true spin serve that you can serve short, that's when I'd recommend adding no-spin serves as a variation, and focusing on keeping this and the spin serves very low, with the second bounce near the endline. Serving no-spin when there's little threat of spin isn't as effective after the first few times. No-spin becomes far more effective when it can be done with a spin motion, when there's a threat of spin. (How do you serve no-spin with a spin motion? Several ways, but primarily by contacting the ball near the handle, where the racket travels slowly even in a vigorous serve.) A no-spin serve with a vigorous motion is called \"heavy no-spin.\" Seriously!\nIt's easier to serve short backspin or no-spin than to serve short sidespin or topspin, or various combinations of these two. So many players fall into the habit of serving just backspin or no-spin when they want to serve short. This greatly limits their options, and makes things a lot easier for the opponent. Well-disguised backspin and no-spin serves are effective, but they are often even more effective if you can throw sidespin and topspin serves into the mix.\nAt the beginning/intermediate level, I recommend a player who has difficulty serving short with spin to add a simple short backspin serve, with the focus on keeping the ball low with as much backspin as possible while still keeping the ball short. This simple backspin serve should be a temporary serve, used only so the player doesn't spend all his time serve & blocking. (Also, since most players will push it back long, you get to practice your serve and loop a lot.) Roughly speaking, by the time a player is 1800, a well-coached player should be able to serve with good spin and keep it short. By the time he's 2000, he should have varied spin serves that go short. By the time he's 2200 he should have varied and deceptive serves that go short. (He should also be able to do all this with long serves.)\nBut you don't have to wait until you're 1800, or 2000, or 2200 to do these things. There are many examples of players who really worked at their serves early on (both short and long), and were able to compete with \"stronger\" players because of this - and because of that stronger competition, they improved faster. Why not you?",

Developing countries account for 95 per cent of new infections and 98 per cent of deaths.\nThe Delhi-based International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) and the Lala Ram Sarup Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, collaborated with the National University of Singapore to develop the test.\nThe test measures five specific chemicals present in urine, the researchers reported last month (July).\nTheir technique measures five 'volatile organic compounds' (VOCs) in urine that have a low boiling point and vaporise at room temperature.\nThe team tested the method in 117 fresh cases of TB and found significantly different levels of these chemicals in TB patients, compared with healthy people.\nIt found a distinct pattern \u2014 three VOCs showed higher levels and two lower levels \u2014 in TB patients, not seen in healthy persons or in patients with lung ailments such as lung cancer or asthma.\nThe levels could also indicate the effect of treatment, the team said.\n\"A major advantage of the proposed method is the non-invasive nature of urine collection. Urine is a comparatively safer matrix as compared to sputum and painless in collection as compared to blood,\" it added.\nICGEB scientist Ranjan Nanda, one of the authors of the paper, explained to SciDev.Net that this was the first stage.\nNanda's team plans to validate the findings from multiple sites across India and involve a larger number of patients using improved data acquisition methods.\nThe team also plans to profile other VOCs in urine samples \u201cto identify the maximum number of molecules,\u201d Nanda said.\nLink to abstract in Analytical Chemistry\nReferences\nAnalytical Chemistry doi:10.1021/ac200265g (2011)",

The banknotes have to conform to specific wants: Reference, Country, Denomination, Issued Banknote, Grade, Price\u2026etc. In other words it \u2018Ticks all the boxes\u2019.\nThe banknote with all the ticks has gone through a rigorous process to end up as a final circulating banknote and subsequently to end up with a collector. The process would have consisted of: Idea, Sketch, Artwork, Pasteup, Engraving, Trials, Proofs, and so on, all executed by skilled craftsmen. In the future, maybe it\u2019s already here, CAD (Computer Aided Design) will take all the earlier processes away, removing most of the human element from production. Leaving the approval of a final design, printing and ultimately placement of the banknote into circulation.\nAt some point an artist was given a brief to design a set of banknotes by world region not by country. Various ideas would have been worked up with nonsensical wording to fill the headings. The preparation for these designs would have taken careful consideration of the minutest detail, being careful not to offend anyone politically or religiously in anyway. Can anyone prove these designs led to a final issued banknote? Does it matter? Not ticking all the boxes, having an open mind, being aware that collecting banknotes can be extended to beyond a catalogue reference number. All or any of these enhance our unique hobby.\nThe twelve surviving preliminary sketches recorded in this article are from a De La Rue artist\u2019s effects. All are undated but must have been created in the late 1950s. Other related artwork obtained at the time relates to this era. Each sketch would have taken a skilled artist two or three days to complete. I suspect they were commissioned by the Design Department at De La Rue, possibly as speculative work to fill down time in slack periods or work for the \u2018stock books\u2019. The \u2018stock books\u2019 would have been full of artwork, complete and part designs, to show prospective clients who could choose elements to be worked up into preliminary pasteups. A high percentage of the De La Rue \u2018stock books\u2019 were disposed of in the late 1990s. One reason for the disposal being the move in 1999 from Basingstoke, Hampshire (De La Rue H.Q.) to Overton, Hampshire (Portals H.Q.), there being less storage space for the archive at Overton. De La Rue had obtained Portals and asset stripped the company, selling off the Manor House, tithe cottages and river - the heritage of Henri de Portal\u2019s and his \u2018family\u2019. Thus creating a bad working environment for the incoming workforce. Ironically, the Design Department moved back to Basingstoke in 2009.\nAccepted pasteups pass to a General Engraver who works on the basic banknote features. Then a succession of artists would work on their specialist area: Vignette Engraver, Lettering Engraver, Plant Engraver, Machine Engine Turning for borders and backgrounds and the most important of all, the Portrait Engraver.\nAll sketches are on thin card 263mm x 174mm, have numerous annotations relating to native patterns used, colours, border designs, heading text and plants and artefacts from the region depicted. The sketches themselves are 150mm x 65mm.\nThanks must go to retired De La Rue staff for their input.\nPam West IBNS Life Member No 79\nNo Main Title on Preliminary Sketch Text on Note\n3 Sketch for a Note for an Eastern Note Pang---?\n5 Sketch for a Note for an Indonesian Note Bank of Indersto\n7 Sketch for an Eastern Note (new to list)\n8 Sketch for a Note for an African Note Bank of Nigeria\n9 Sketch for a Morrocan Note Banque du Maroc\n10 Sketch for a Note for a Buddhist country Rinciria of Amripia\n11 Sketch for a Note for Mohommedans Syrian Remrsmi\n14 Sketch for a Note for a Mohammedan country Government of Transionia\n16 Sketch for a Note for a Northern country Nroponrch Ghian?\n17 Sketch for a Note for an Australasian country Pacific Islands\n18 Sketch for a Note for an Indonesian country Text illegible\n19 Sketch for a Note for a Mesopotamia Note Banque de Syrie\n20 Sketch for a Note for a Muslim country Banque de Mpsime\n21 Sketch for a Manchurian Note (new to list)\nThree of the sketches have annotations on the reverse:\n3 This border will be alright - do the duplex separately. *\n5 Do the border only - This design is very good.\n8 This is alright - please make a finished design -\n* Duplex = Two working pattern in Litho",

    "context": "I guess the question ''What does Illustration mean'' is something I rarely stop to think about or have answered so this is a nice opportunity to get my thoughts down in response to this. Like everything in life I think people can have their own interpretation of what Illustration means to them individually. When I try to explain to people what I am studying, people who are not in the creative industries don't understand what I do, so I either say it's like Graphic Design, even though it's not!, some people at that point get it and some still don't have a clue, so I mention pictures in children's story books and explain how they are created by Illustrators, it's the easiest explanation to give sometimes.\nI read the 2012 article in Varoom magazine by Michael Salu, he quotes ''As our visual language evolves, the playing field is levelling. Graphic designs, sculptors, painters, creative developers and even musicians amorphously meander across different parts of our creative industries.\"\nThe above quote to me sparks excitement, that the industry is becoming more diverse and versatile, I think traditional illustration was more confined to just being an illustrator and only using drawing, painting, collage as means of communicating a message, this was something that worried me a little in second year when I discovered a love for making, I wasn't sure if there would be a market for me out there as my work isn't about drawings, but more about making and creating a 3D world. However as I have progressed through the course and have looked towards wonderful inspiring illustrators such as Lord Whitney, Vanessa Boer and Polly Becker, and even Hattie Stewart - It has really instilled confidence in me that you can be true to yourself regardless of what medium you use to communicate your work and that there is a market out there regardless.\nFor example if there was a Theatre Set with a violinist playing music, that in a way to me is illustrating a mood, a meaning and a narrative. That's why I am excited how the boundaries are changing, to me it says there are no limits. I like to think in the future I will be illustrating through various mediums such as drawing, props, objects, costume and use of photography/music. I read an article on Hattie Stewart who has been collaborating with the fashion/beauty world internationally, which really shows that different industries are inter-twining and collaborating, again this is really interesting for people such as myself who will be graduating next year. Technology developments are also altering how Illustrators create and see their work, we are also having to broaden our skill sets, which may not be a bad thing. Another great example of a versatile illustrator is Jan Svankmajer, he uses what ever medium he feels relevant to use such as film, photography, animation, I-stop motion, drawing etc, I love that his work is varied and not confined, he also pushed the boundaries as he was banned for 10 years from making any films, due to a controversial piece he created that had political connections.\nThe term 'Illustration' dates back to the 15th Century when wood cut illustration became available in books, it also originates from the latin word 'illu'stro' to enlighten or irradiate. Polly Becker's view on what illustration means to her ''is the idea that an illustrator might be trying to elucidate, shed light, or be lucid'', this is a really nice idea, I think aims and themes in illustrators work can alter how they see illustration. That's the beauty of it, it's different in everyones eyes and mind.\nWhen I look back to my work in the foundation Visual Communication course, my work was very ephemeral and a little graphic, in my first year of my degree I was still very sketchbook based and my work was all flat and I didn't really take risks, then I discovered making in 3D, and I have been working this way since, developing into character making and I have recently become fascinated with props and found objects, I feel like I am still evolving though which is a humbling feeling. I still really enjoy collage and using ink pens, I realise that I don't do as much of this anymore and I hope to get back to it soon. In the future I hope to be playing more on the senses by collaboration or bringing my work to life by use lighting, music, props and film, and I also hope that I stay true to myself.\nI personally don't think the name 'Illustration' should be changed, as it's clear that it can be interpreted in many ways and can be delivered via any medium.",

    "context": "The.\nBut is this form of retrenchment restricted to isolated cases in the IT industry? Most definitely not. It takes various forms in times of a downturn and things have not changed since the last such upheaval in 2001. Most affected are freshers and junior employees who have no knowledge of the laws or common business practices. Currently, confirmed appointment letters for campus hires are not being honored or simply delayed on various pretexts, with the objective of tiring out the young students yearning to start their careers post a degree program often funded by loans . Anectodal evidence suggests that leading IT companies, backed by marquee promoters amongst others, are employing such tactics. A large captive French-United States multinational corporation is said to have employed worse practices, where young employees working on projects or training were summarily escorted to taxis after being asked to resign across the table.\nIn this day and age of open information and transparency, such practices pose a serious threat to a company's credibility where it matters most. Ad hoc hiring, highly skewed planning, and an irrational optimism about the future have led to this situation. Mission, vision and culture statements ring quite hollow during adversity and HR managers, who are expected to uphold these values, prefer toeing the management line instead of holding up the mirror to them.\nSuch anectodal evidence can easily be translated into statistical evidence if the Department of Labor so desires, or students get together on social media or approach the Courts/Labor Commissioner in their respective states.\nWhat is the legal framework on all of this in India? That, unfortunately, is unclear and has been so over the years. IT workers are given fancy designations which keep them out of the definition of \u201cworkmen\u201d under the archaic Industrial Disputes Act which governs such situations. It is well understood that this is not the appropriate Act for governing the HR issues of the IT industry, but different governments over the last 20 years have shied away from a enacting the appropriate legislative framework. The IT industry has, since the 1990s, got friendly treatment from governments on three key issues:\n(i) A favorable tax regime even when it was large enough not to need incentives.\n(ii) Getting massive tracts of land at concessional rates, and then building horizontally despite vertical structures being the norm for much more efficient use of the land.\n(iii) Allowing the industry to function without an appropriate legislative framework for HR issues in what is predominantly a people led industry.\nIt is not my intent to argue for permanent employment but, it is my case that prevention of practices, such as the ones mentioned earlier to merely reduce the costs of separation - especially when it involves young students and junior professionals - is now a necessity. Sensitivity, compensation, and funding for reskilling executives would go a long way in demonstrating some compassion, and a fraction of the huge pile of cash that the IT companies have garnered could be used for such purposes. Keep in mind that India has no social security net like in the West. Many families depend on the progeny that's the first generation to be employed in the new economy. Promoters and managements, who have amassed a fair amount of wealth, can well afford to show magnanimity, if not act out of ethical considerations, and make this process more humane. Similar instances of layoffs in the U.S. would have invited class action suits for wrongful termination and it is the same companies which would have paid millions of dollars to settle out of court. India does not have such provisions of collective action but courts are now selectively more open to hearing such cases.\nThe other aspect is India's highly flawed educational system which churns out engineers with scant focus on curriculum for emerging technologies to align with industry demand. This requires companies to train their intake. This is done based purely on the basis of skill gaps existing in that particular company at a specific point in time. Freshers are thus thrust into areas purely by chance and not necessarily into technologies which will remain relevant in the mid-term. Based on project needs, many fall for the lure of going abroad even for routine jobs and neglect the fact that continuous reskilling is a must in this industry. This leads to a sense of entitlement when the going is good and exposes deficiencies during downturns. Young professionals must not lose sight of continuously learning emerging technologies to stay relevant.\nMany do not know that Kanwal Rekhi, the legendary venture capitalist, and entrepreneur, was fired thrice in his career in the U.S. It was then that he decided that he will never work for anyone ever again. The U.S. has the ecosystem to promote such an endeavor. In India, this ecosystem is still in its nascent stages and operates on a very small scale. For IT engineers, this is the mindset which will help them overcome odds in their journey.\nWhile this transition happens over the next generation, IT industry doyens and the government should look to holistically address the problem of layoffs, which are likely to only increase over the next few years. Taking short cuts and promoting dubious practices will ultimately come to bite the very hand which has led us to prosperity these last thirty years.\nThis article was first published here.\n",

    "context": "In the modern mobile world all organizations are beginning to build their own enterprise mobile applications, which makes them turn to specialized mobile application testing services to respond to new challenges and market requirements. To analyze how today\u2019s enterprise trends shape this process, it is useful to consider two surveys conducted by trustworthy organizations: Apperian mobile application management company and Cisco networking company.\nAccording to the Cisco forecast, the amount of mobile-connected devices will increase significantly and there will be 11.5 billion devices by 2019. Last year the number of mobile-connected devices exceeded the world\u2019s overall population. Companies are doing their best to roll out applications, and make them as easy as possible to use.\nApperian research demonstrates that 60% of companies are developing their own mobile apps to support and speed up main business processes. 67% of respondents consider improved business processes as a goal for mobility.\nTop challenges\nThe respondents were asked to name the top challenges to achieving their mobility goals. The results were as follows:\n- Security concerns (67 % )\n- Determining ROI (32 %)\n- A lack of funds (29 %)\n- Reaching Bring your own device (BYOD) policy, contracted or unmanaged devices (26%)\n- A lack of management tools (23%)\nSecurity\nSecurity tops the list of the challenges that organizations face when they develop their applications. This is due to the constant evolution of mobile security threats. All mobility programs must ensure that they appropriately respond to the security risks.\nThe Apperian Research shows that less than 25% of respondents can see when the information is lost. That means that some 75% can\u2019t detect the events that can lead to corporate data leaks if the right controls are not in place.\nVisibility and Investments\nAny enterprise mobility program need to be thoroughly analyzed in order to be successful. According to the Cisco forecast more than 50% of all organizations have no idea whether their apps are used. 48% do understand who is using their applications and 42% can see how frequently apps are run.\nAll surveyed organizations need greater visibility into statistics about their app usage.\nParticipants stated the list of investments they are making to increase the adoption:\n- More applications for core business processes (47%)\n- User interface/experience improvements (43%)\n- Training (35%)\n- Analytics (35%)\n- Agile development with user input (33%)\nRecommendations\nThe Apperian provides the organizations seeking a competitive advantage with a number of recommendations.\n- During the development of the application, focus first on main business processes\n- The best option is to support business processes with internally developed apps\n- Invest money in technology to manage the applications\n- Think of your users as clients\n- Invest in analytics\nTo take advantage of the continuing mobile revolution you need to analyze the needs of your customers. Moreover, it is vital to keep abreast of the current situation on the market of mobile applications. If you follow all the recommendations, you are likely to have remarkable success in the industry of mobile application development.",

    "context": "Dear Alexander Graham Bell Community\n,\nThis week, I'd like to take the time to recognize an outstanding figure in the field of listening and spoken language. Last Thursday,\nJane Madell, PhD, LSLS Cert AVT\n, was awarded the\nMarion Downs Award for Pediatric Excellence\nby the American Academy of Audiology, in recognition of her outstanding commitment to ensuring that every child with hearing loss has the opportunity to learn to listen, speak and participate in society. Jane is a giant in pediatric audiology and has established standards of practice that we can all look to as a model for serving children with hearing loss\n.\nIf I were to pick one word to describe Jane, it would be \"determined.\" Once she sets herself upon a goal, she will achieve it. Jane's determination is best seen in her absolute commitment to providing a solid foundation in listening and spoken language to every child she serves no matter their age or hearing loss. She understands, and incorporates in her work, that parents are vital to the success of children learning to listen and speak, and she honors them through her activity with their child\n.\nWhat sets Jane apart is her unwavering and rigorous standards for success. Jane insists that not only should her patients be able to speak and hear, but also that they should be able to do so on a par with their hearing peers. These pioneering standards have allowed for a more effective progression of speech outcomes, and Jane firmly believes that nearly every child with hearing loss can learn to speak and join in mainstream education. It is a testament to her that so many of her patients have done just that (and if you benefited from working with Jane, we hope you'll\nshare your story with us\n.) Working with Jane isn't easy; she is strong-willed and has high expectations. But the impact of her work - whether you are her patient, student or colleague - is immensely rewarding.\nJane has left a remarkable footprint in our field far beyond her direct impact on her patients. Drawing from her wealth of experience, Jane co-authored the text\nPediatric Audiology: Diagnosis, Technology and Management\nto help other professionals better serve the community. She is a prolific writer who has contributed to Volta Voices and writes a robust blog,\nHearing & Kids\n.\nI'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jane and thank her for her years of work in service to people who are deaf and hard of hearing. She is truly an ideal model for our community. I am honored to work closely with Jane on the AG Bell Academy Board of Directors. Seeing her dedication to the craft of listening and spoken language in practice is a gift. Individuals of such passion and extraordinary initiative are exceptional. But I am most grateful for Jane's generosity in sharing her knowledge, her experiences and her commitment to excellence\n.\nWith Jane at the Volta Bureau\nJane travels around the world to spread the mission of listening and spoken language and its best practices. This year, she will present at our\nInternational Symposium\nin Buenos Aires held jointly with Instituto Oral Modelo, as well as the\nAG Bell Listening and Spoken Language Symposium\nhere in Washington, D.C\n.\nIf you see Jane at any of these events, I encourage you to congratulate her on her award and to take the time to ask questions of her. You will never forget her passion for our field and for the impact that AG Bell and listening and spoken language has made on a great many families around the world\n.\nI am always available to you at\ninfo@agbell.org\nand at 202-337-5220.\nUntil next week,\nEmilio Alonso-Mendoza\nP.S. The\nAG Bell AVEd Scholarship\nand\nDoreen Pollack Scholarship\nfor AVT candidates will close this Friday, April 14. Get your applications in ASAP!\nEvery great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world\n.\nHarriet Tubman",

    "context": "\u201cThe notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over,\u201d Thomas Friedman announced in yesterday\u2019s New York Times. \u201cIf you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner.\u201d He\u2019s right on both counts. The returns students can expect from their bachelor\u2019s degrees have been shrinking, and every worker out there needs to constantly pick up new skills in order to compete in the workforce long-term.\nThen Friedman writes, \u201cAnd that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill.\u201d (His patronizing italics.) The gist of the column, whose insurance-brochure headline is \u201cOwning Your Own Future,\u201d is that too few young professionals are ready to do that.\nBut there\u2019s no crisis in \u201cself-motivation.\u201d There is, however, a shortage of resources and opportunities\u2014disproportionately facing women, people of color, young people, and people without advanced degrees, among others\u2014to learn enough marketable skills fast enough to get paid fairly for them. And Friedman\u2019s brand of libertarian scolding isn\u2019t helping.\nIt might be easy to imagine that every college student in the U.S. is a beneficiary of the kind of privilege that puts them vastly out of touch with everyone else in the country who\u2019s trying to earn a living on a high school diploma or less. But go stand in the middle of a college quad or on the floor of a struggling manufacturing plant and declare that \u201chaving an agile learning mind-set will be the new skill set of the 21st century\u201d (Friedman\u2019s quoting an \u201ceducation-to-work expert\u201d here), and see what kind of response you get. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019d be identically unkind.\nHe\u2019s right to assert that the workplace is rapidly changing, perhaps even more rapidly than in generations past. He\u2019s also right that staying set in your ways won\u2019t keep you competitive, and that you can\u2019t secure a career\u2019s worth of training in four years of college. Nor is it news to actual mechanics that \u201cif you\u2019re getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it\u2019s not to be a \u2018grease monkey.\u2019 It\u2019s to be a repairman for a computer with wheels.\u201d\nYoung people entering the workforce have understood this kind of thing for years. Decades before the first Tesla was a twinkle in Elon Musk\u2019s eye, parents were haughtily informing their teenage kids that they\u2019d hold many different jobs over the course of their careers, some of which hadn\u2019t been invented yet. This has long earned eye rolls\u2014not out of disbelief, but out of sheer obviousness.\nInforming the American workforce that \u201cMore is now on you\u201d isn\u2019t just unhelpful, it\u2019s also grossly unfair. Plenty of employers don\u2019t need or want workers to learn so many new skills that they outgrow their roles, and many others don\u2019t offer the time or resources for additional job training\u2014let alone raises and promotions to those who find their own ways to \u201cskill up.\u201d It isn\u2019t individuals who\u2019ve failed to keep up with the times. (\u201cSome are up for that, some not,\u201d Friedman sniffs.) It\u2019s the government and employers that have yet to adapt to the realities of the modern workplace.\nHad they done so, the pay gaps by both race and gender would be footnotes in history (both are alive and well), employment discrimination wouldn\u2019t exist (companies are still struggling with diversity as Trump rolls back protections), real wages wouldn\u2019t be stagnating (as they have for four decades), automation would be making room for all kinds of new and exciting skills-training opportunities (that\u2019s possible but barely happening), American millennials wouldn\u2019t be unemployed at three times the overall rate (which they are), and no one would be talking seriously about the need for a universal basic income (like Musk is).\nThis month, the class of 2017 is graduating into a much healthier job market than their peers did in the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. But as Fast Company\u2018s Lydia Dishman points out, \u201c2007\u2019s economy is a pretty low bar.\u201d Despite their gobs of student loan debt and the fact that they\u2019ll be competing for work with a cohort of which the majority is underemployed, gen-Z job seekers remain amazingly optimistic about their career prospects.\nSo does Friedman, more or less. With just a little more willingness to learn, and maybe an assist from Khan Academy, he suggests that the next generation of employees\u2014college grads and otherwise\u2014won\u2019t just wind up with happy, prosperous careers. They\u2019ll also stop electing proto-authoritarians and start voting for \u201cleaders who inspire and equip their citizens to be strong people who can own their own futures.\u201d\nGen-Z, you\u2019ll have to get back to Friedman on that one. You\u2019re about to discover just how far your \u201cagile learning mind-set\u201d and the sheer force of optimism will take you. Good luck out there\n[Source\u201dtimesofindia\u201d]",

My parents divorced when I was two years old and I went to live with my mum. She happily remarried giving me the opportunity to have three parents to take care of me, and also to expect great things from me.\nI was a nice and happy little girl that obeyed to almost everything I was asked to. I wanted to feel loved, protected and appreciated by my family, teachers and peers. Thus, I became a straight A\u2019s student, hard working, responsible, creative, smart and sensitive teen. I had the most wonderful parents that supported me, and was surrounded by a good group of friends. Played basketball, practiced Ninjutsu (Japanese martial art), and studied German afterschool. I was an active member in my community and, seemingly, I had it all. There was no apparent reason for me to feel lonely during my teenage years.\nDespite my outgoing and high performance character, I frequently felt alone and lost. For me, it was like living two different lives at the same time. The first of which represented the perfect student, achieving everybody\u2019s expectations and creating the impression that my life was enviably and picture-perfect in front of others.\nThe second life was nothing close to what one could understand as perfect\u2026 I felt a lot of pressure to always fulfill other people\u2019s wishes, without being able to because that\u2019s impossible; even though I had some friends, I didn\u2019t feel I fitted in because some of them referred to me as a nerd, busty and four-eyes. Therefore, I thought nobody liked me and that I couldn\u2019t trust my friends; I didn\u2019t want to be smart anymore; and, hated my body.\nI kept my nice fa\u00e7ade, but felt very isolated with no one to talk to; especially to my parents who I tried to protect and wanted not to worry about me. I didn\u2019t know who I really was; I felt that nobody could understand me, disconnected from the world, hopeless about my future, and preferred to stay at home watching TV to distract myself from the reality than to party\u2026\nLuckily, I found two escape routes: acting and traveling. I loved both activities and I fought for them! Those hobbies gave me the possibility to be someone else, not worrying about who I was or what I was supposed to do. While on stage I could set myself free! And, thanks to travel abroad by myself with the excuse to learn English and German, I found my way to free myself from being hostage in my own home and town.\nI really enjoyed living in different countries such as England, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, etc. With none of my people around me, I thought I could be my true self. The people I met knew who I really was, with no judgments or already defined expectations. I felt so freed! However, that feeling couldn\u2019t last forever. Eventually, I had to go back home.\nI knew things had to change. I couldn\u2019t live like that forever. But I didn\u2019t know how to do it and I couldn\u2019t help it. When the high school graduation was getting closer, I got much more stressed and anxious, not just because I needed to be the first of my class, but because I had to decide about my future. How can you think about it and feel good if you are not motivated and enthusiastic about what\u2019s next?\nWhen the time arrived I graduated first of my class and started College to complete my M.A. in Business Administration & Management, and another M.A. in Law. I thought it was my chance to a fresh start. I moved to a new city, had new roommates and classmates. However, nothing changed within me\u2026 This was the time when I realized it had nothing to do with how others treated me or expected things from me. I didn\u2019t have to change my environment to feel accepted and understood; I had to change something within me. But, what and how?\nMy stress and anxiety increased to the point where I start having panic attacks. Thus, I got introduced to mindfulness techniques and I could get that anxiety under control. Even though it was really helpful, I needed to find my own way, my own path, and my purpose. However, life didn\u2019t stop from moving forward. So, in the meantime, I graduated from College and did what everybody expected from me: work for large multinational organizations.\nSome years later, while working on finding my passion, I started experiencing the coaching techniques effects on myself. I found it life-changing, so I became a Life Coach by Instituto Europeo de Coaching, an International Coach Federation (ICF) accredited institution.\nThat was it! I found myself! I could live my truth! I set my true self free once and for all! With that clarity of mind and spirit, I founded Itaca Coaching. Itaca is a Greek Island, home of Odysseus, the hero from the Greek Homer\u2019s epic poem the Odyssey. His quest to reach Itaca is a symbol of the journey we live when pursuing our goals. Illa, my name, means Island in my mother language.\nThus, I knew that working with high achiever teenagers to help them and their parents to feel happy, motivated and connected was my purpose in life. To support them in their own journeys, so they can meet their aims, just like Odysseus finally made it, and reached Itaca.\nI started working with Illa when I was a Senior at HS. And, thanks to the coaching program I managed to relax and control my stress. That allowed me to achieve my goal of passing my finals and starting my College degree. The fact that I reached all my objectives, step by step, made me aware that I am capable of accomplishing whatever I plan. I just have to set the goals clearly and work to get them done. I totally recommend working with Illa!N.S.\nI enjoyed the coaching process with Illa very much. I learnt various tools which are useful for different situations in my life. But above all I know myself much better. In every session I felt comfortable, relaxed, and working as a team with a good professional, that felt very close at the same time. After each one of the sessions I felt with renewed energy. The coaching process has surprised me very positively. I feel very satisfied and happy. Illa is extraordinarily supportive in every aspect.P.V.",

I also count on my friends to let me in on their favorites. This week, I am going to share with you some of my current go-to products that I love and why they work for me.\nAgadir Argan Oil Daily Volumizing Shampoo\nThis shampoo is incredible! It is sulfate free, so it doesn\u2019t strip my color or fade my highlights. I have fine, limp hair so it is always a challenge to find a volumizing shampoo. Some shampoos give my hair volume, but dry it out. Then shampoos for dry hair leave it limp and oily. Not this one-it leaves my hair super soft, yet not feeling oily. The smell is lovely, too.\nThe Body Shop Dry Oil for Body, Face & Hair\nI saw this at the Body Shop and was intrigued. What is \u201cdry oil?\u201d It is luxurious, that\u2019s for sure! I put his on my body right after a shower, while the skin is still wet and it soaks right in-leaving no oily residue behind. My skin is sooooo soft for a full 24 hours. I am currently using it in the scent Sweet Lemon, but it comes in other scents, too. I also rub it into my heels. I have not used it on my face or hair; although the label says it is appropriate to do so. I wish it came in a larger bottle\u2026I love it that much.\nUrban Decay Naked 2 Palette\nOh. Emm. Gee! I have never been a big fan of eye shadow palettes, preferring to select my own shades; but this one takes the cake. I find myself reaching for it every single day. All of the colors are beautiful and go on smoothly. I find that this one palette can produce hundreds of different looks, from natural to all out glam. Check out the picture with the all the colors. Love.\nOscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo\nRemember what I said above about having hair that tends to be oily? Well, this is my secret weapon. To keep my ends healthy, I don\u2019t wash my hair every day. On the second day, my roots are looking oily so I put some of this powder on my palms, flip my hair over, and rub it into my roots. Brush it through and voila! All the oil is gone! As an added bonus, the powder gives the roots texture, and that gives me some added volume. This stuff is THE BOMB.\nMAC Dazzle glass in Date Night\nI love MAC lip glosses in general and I have several. This is the one I reach for the most, as it can be used alone for a sheer \u201cdazzle\u201d or on top of a dramatic lip color for a pouty look. It is thick, as MAC lip glosses are, but that means the lasting power is excellent. It looks more glittery (is that even a word?) in the tube than it does on the lip, so don\u2019t let that stop you from adding this to your makeup bag.\nMakeup Brushes by e.l.f.\nAnother one of my secret tools: eye shadow brushes that I get for a whopping $1! Yes, you read that correctly. My eye shadow looks are created with dollar brushes! These gems are from the budget beauty line e.l.f. and I buy them at Target. They never lose any hairs, keep the shadow from splattering everywhere and are soft on the skin. They have never disappointed.\nMaybelline The Falsies Mascara in Black Drama\nWant dramatic, false looking lashes for about $7? This is your mascara! When I am rocking a dark, smoky eye this mascara delivers the drama. It is super black, goes on glossy and doesn\u2019t flake or smudge. Since I am all about beauty on a budget, I am forever thankful to my sister for this find. Not for the timid\u2026this takes your lashes and really does make them look like \u201cfalsies.\u201d\nHave any of you tried these products? Are you planning on getting any? Please leave me a comment as I would love to know how they worked for you. Until next time, be beautiful on the inside and out!!\n7 Comments\nI genuinely enjoy looking through on this web site , it has got superb content . \u201cWhen a man\u2019s willing and eager, the gods join in.\u201d by Aeschylus.\nYou are my inhalation , I have few web logs and infrequently run out from to post ..\nThanks, I\u2019ve recently been looking for info about this topic for a while and yours is the best I\u2019ve discovered till now.

    "context": "By Author Interviews / Source: NPR\nIt\u2019s a cool August morning as I ride in Magnus Hansen\u2019s dented pickup truck through the verdant hills of south Greenland. We\u2019re in search of his flock of 500 sheep grazing on the slopes. Soon we encounter three animals grazing by the gravel on the dirt road. The two ewes and a lamb first eye us warily from the bushes, then scurry across the road. Nearby is a shimmering fjord, but less than 10 miles away, though we can\u2019t see it, lies Greenland\u2019s mighty ice cap, a mile thick in the center of the island.\nHansen\u2019s sheep farm, called Tasilikulooq, sits amid glassy lakes and sloping hills. When I first arrive here, his red tractor sits next to a dusty snowmobile, a reminder of the punishing cold he and his family brave each winter. But it\u2019s not the brutality of the coming winter that concerns Hansen right now. He\u2019s worried about the travails of the summer.\nThat\u2019s because it has been horribly dry here for months. Hansen fears that his flock of sheep might be malnourished if the pastures don\u2019t soon recover from a hot, dry summer so he can harvest the grass for winter hay feeding.\n\u201cThe seasons here have been very difficult lately,\u201d says Hansen. The average animal in his flock in the summer of 2015 was 2 to 4 pounds lighter than normal. Hot summers over the past decade have cost him thousands of dollars in losses, he says.\nGreenland is an Arctic nation, but along the fringe of the island, between the ice and sea, lies land. And in the south portion of the country, this land is arable. The fields and shrubbery of Tasilikulooq are among the verdant rolling hills that inspired the Vikings to call this place Greenland. They arrived around 985 A.D. and began raising livestock, beginning a tradition that a few dozen Inuit sheep farms continue in this region today, providing meat, primarily, for a tiny portion of the population.\nSince Greenland\u2019s 60,000 citizens rely almost entirely on food imports from Denmark and other European countries, farmers and officials have hoped that steadily rising temperatures, and shorter winters, would spur a growth in agriculture here. (Summer temperatures have risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in southern Greenland since 1975, increasing the growing season by two weeks.) And media stories about Arctic gardening in greenhouses or the warming temperatures have hyped the possibilities.\nInstead, says Aqalooraq Frederiksen, a third-generation farmer who works at a regional farmer assistance bureau, the dry summers are diminishing the prospects for Greenlandic farming.\nRecent summers have been both warm and dry, causing drought in south Greenland, says John Cappelen, a climatologist at Danish Meteorological Institute, which maintains climate data for the island.\n\u201cIn 2015, for example, we didn\u2019t have spring,\u201d said Greenlandic agricultural consultant Henrik Motzfeldt Egede. \u201cIt just went from a very cold winter to a hot, dry summer.\u201d He says growth in pastures for livestock was \u201cvery bad as a result.\u201d Meanwhile, the number of sheep farmers in Greenland has fallen from 74 in 1983 to about 37 farms today, says Frederiksen.\nTo compensate, farmers try to irrigate their pastures and hayfields, and they purchase animal feed to supplement the hay in the winter time. On an August morning by a dock near Tasilikulooq I watched a loader moving giant plastic bags of fertilizer and sheep fodder, 1,850 tons in all, from a small ship onto shore. Such shipments are a lifeline for sheep farmer Miki Egede, whose nearby farm, one of the largest on the island, boasts 600 sheep and 31 cattle.\n\u201cOur incomes just haven\u2019t been able to keep up with the overall increase of our expenses,\u201d says the farmer, who is no relation to the consultant. \u201cExpenses in the form of fertilizers, fodder for the animals, and everyday items. Looks like it is the sheep farmers with the fewest sheep that were hit the hardest.\u201d\nGovernment subsidies, meant to support Greenland\u2019s farms, now stand at $1.8 million per year. There are persistent rumors that the government could cut those subsidies, however, to save costs given that the sector is shrinking and provides relatively little food to Greenlandic citizens.\n\u201cThis year we also had drought throughout most of the early summer, but limited rainfall late in the summer made the harvest better than last year,\u201d says Egede. But severe drought has struck Greenland in two of the past five years and recently published research suggests the trend may continue because of large scale changes in Arctic weather systems.\nA trip to the government\u2019s testing farm near the southern tip of the island underscores some of the challenges farmers face here. Efa Poulsen, the gardener, tests different varieties of carrots, turnips, potatoes and feed crops like barley. Inside two greenhouses he is growing other vegetables, including tomatoes and cucumbers.\nPoulsen removes plastic sheeting from a set of turnip plants and pulls up a turnip and cuts off its greens. After wiping off the dirt with a towel, he cuts me a slice; it\u2019s crisp and sweet in my mouth. The farm grows tasty vegetables and trains a few sheep farmers a year, says Frederiksen. But the farm can\u2019t produce enough food to cover the costs of the operation.\nA handful of farmers have tried to grow vegetables for human consumption in gardens or fields, but almost all have found it unprofitable since yields are low and there\u2019s limited availability of farm labor. So the few dozen experiments with growing vegetables here, including a few greenhouses, only serve to feed the families that maintain the gardens.\nBut there may be one solution to the woes facing Greenland\u2019s farms \u2014 bees, says Ole Guldager, a commercial beekeeper who has been maintaining beehives in Narsarsuaq, a small airport town near the southern tip of the island. The part-time beekeeper produces between 550 and 650 pounds of honey annually for sale in groceries and tourist shops.\nThe hives thrive during hot summers when southern Greenland\u2019s plentiful wildflowers are in bloom. Guldager is convinced that beekeeping would allow farmers to \u201cmake a living without being subsidized.\u201d But beekeeping hasn\u2019t caught on. He is the only commercial beekeeper on the island.",

Severe drought has struck Greenland in two of the past five years and recently published research suggests the trend may continue because of large scale changes in Arctic weather systems.",

    "context": "The real currency in SEO is the number of links that you have to your site. It determines your rank in the search engine result page (SERP) and hence the incoming traffic. It\u2019s a very simple equation, but not an easy one to solve. Hence, link building is an important aspect of SEO. So, how do you do it? Link building campaigns are the answers. However, organizing the campaign properly can be really tough, especially because of the low success rate that comes out of it. So, how do you maximize the link building campaigns?\nOne size DOESN\u2019T fit all\nIf you have tried writing a generic email and forwarding it to as many link partners as possible, then you couldn\u2019t have done a worse campaign. There are so many problems with this approach that it might take one email just to explain them! Every link partner is different and hence the email requests which you send for backlinks should not sound too generic.\nSend acquaintances\nIt\u2019s not like \u2018Hey, I just met you, this is crazy, here\u2019s my website, link me maybe\u2019. The link partner should at least know you at some level. It is likely that being webmaster you might have met numerous other webmasters at different conferences and seminars. Your success rate will increase if you send acquaintances rather than total strangers.\nUse templates with caution\nYou might have sent many link requests in the past, and would already have your favorite template. However, you should not let this fact be obvious from the email that you send. Every request should have a sense of personalization. A way to do this is to circulate the email among your colleagues and get information on whether it appears personalized or not. To keep things fresh, you should write new template for each type of group. While making the templates, keep enough room for personalization. Just before sending it, spend a few minutes making the email as specific as possible.\nHave something meaningful to give\nYour link partner would be persuaded only when you have something valuable to offer too. You can\u2019t of course provide a backlink to the link partner because it would have a negative impact on the SERP rankings. The help can be in terms of arranging for links for the partner from different sources, or maybe even connect at a personal level, maybe give an ego boost in some way.\nLink building is pretty much like building a relationship with humans. There is always the factor of sincere investment of time and an honest effort in ensuring mutual satisfaction. Your outreach program should highlight these things to your link partner. Do these well, and your success rate in link building campaign would have a very positive impact.\nLogicSpeak:\nBacklinks play a very important role in today\u2019s date; they are one of the strongest pillars in raising your site on top in search engines. Hence it is very much necessary to acquire backlinks from relevant and authority sites in order to achieve a good link profile. In short, the mantra to be kept in mind while acquiring backlinks is \u2018Be a real person and connect with real people to earn links\u2019\nPrevious Post: Facebook set eyes on professional networking website",
    "question": "What are some strategies to maximize the success of link building campaigns in SEO?",
    "answer": "Some strategies to maximize the success of link building campaigns in SEO include avoiding generic emails and instead personalizing each request to the specific link partner, sending requests to acquaintances rather than total strangers, using email templates with caution and ensuring they don't appear too generic, and offering something meaningful to the link partner, such as arranging for links from different sources or connecting at a personal level.

    "context": "Experienced by Kimatni Rawlins.\nThe Small Wonder from Germany is just that; full of inquisitive surprises, laden with technology expected from the Cayenne and built with \u201cHappy Feet\u201d in the form of AWD that excels on both racetracks and rocky hills. It\u2019s true as I was a witness to the Macan\u2019s diversity recently at Willow Springs Raceway in Rosamond, California. I know what you are thinking. Why in the world is Automotive Rhythms testing a SUV in environments properly suited for coupes? According to Porsche the revelation is quite simple: \u201cWe have shown with the Cayenne and the Panamera that many of the very same attributes that make the 911 a great sports car translate well to other segments of the marketplace. The Macan continues this tradition and represents the first time such a level of performance and agility has ever been available to those seeking a compact SUV package.\u201d\nMacan, Indonesian for \u201ctiger,\u201d is denoted by just two models: the $49,900 Macan S and the $72,300 Macan Turbo. But if you are familiar with Porsche\u2019s a la carte pricing menu you will be able to relate to the $102,435 sticker price on the Mahogany Metallic model we tested. It was replete with the $1,385 Air Suspension, $1,490 Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus), $1,600 Adaptive Cruise Control, $1,290 Sport Chrono Package (adds Launch Control and SPORT PLUS Button), $4,290 Burmester High-End Surround Sound System and the gorgeous $3,300 21\u201d 911 Turbo design wheels. In total our vehicle was optioned out with 34 distinct line items, most of which are akin to the DNA of performance engineered vehicles. In fact, the first Porsche was built in Austria in 1948 and every car since has been developed around motorsports. The German brand says there are no demographic targets for the Macan, but I don\u2019t see too many young, male trendsetters rushing for the Indonesian tiger. Actually, all of the onlookers who approached us while cruising around Pasadena were females, and unless they are weekend racers most of the aforementioned options are not necessary.\nStylistically, the Macan is a miniature version of the Cayenne from the B pillar forward, and something else interesting moving rearward. The sloping roofline is called the \u201cfly line\u201d by Porsche designers while the \u201ctight at the top\u201d and \u201cwide at the bottom\u201d tailgate is reminiscent of the 911. But it gives the vehicle a polarizing view from that angle. A grab handle has been forfeited in place of an open/close button on the windshield wiper motor cover. Typical large front air intakes, a dominant grille and a 38-pound wraparound, aluminum clamshell hood dominate the front fascia with dynamics and efficiency. A cadre of design cues have been borrowed from the 918 Spyder to illuminate the Macan\u2019s stature including side blade inserts (Lava Black, Carbon Fiber or body color), rear LED taillights and the multifunction steering wheel with paddle shifters. I particularly like the Carbon Fiber variant.\nOur two-hour drive up to Willow Springs in the Macan Turbo featured highway and mountain roads that were well suited for the SUV\u2019s mechanics. The pompous 3.6-liter Twin Turbo V6 kicks out 400 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque (from 1,350 rpm) and exhibits no obvious turbo lag. It sprints from 0 to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds (4.4 with Sport Chrono) and manages 17 city/23 hwy mpg. This engine partners with the 7-speed PDK (double clutch) transmission, air suspension including Porsche Active Suspension Management (sits 15 mm lower than the standard steel spring suspension), PTV Plus and the staggered 21\u201d rims tucked in Michelin performance rubber. This combination offered acceleration, braking, handling and agility unfathomable on a sport ute. Literally, we were chasing 911s around Willow Springs in the Macans. Porsche Traction Management (PTM) does most of the thinking for the active AWD system so the driver doesn\u2019t have to. It variably distributes up to 100% of the vehicle\u2019s torque from front to rear and side to side with the addition of PTV Plus.\nOn the other hand the Macan S is powered by Porsche\u2019s brand new 3-liter Twin Turbo V6 with 340 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque available between 1,450-5,000 rpm. It runs from 0 to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds and also achieves 17 city/23 hwy mpg. The S also handled well on the track but not as impressively as the Turbo since it was sitting on all-season tires and adorned with the steel suspension which required more work from the vehicle operator. After the track exercises we went off-roading up steep trails. An \u201coff-road\u201d button recalibrates the suspension for the task at hand and the Hill Descent button puts the vehicle in auto pilot as it self brakes and crawls at very low speeds down whatever hill you came up. Incredibly extraordinary!\nBack inside you will experience a similar cabin as the Cayenne or the Panamera for that matter. The ignition switch is on the left of the steering wheel as usual and the sloping center console is decorated with an array of function buttons from the Sport button to the HVAC settings. The front seating position is 2.75\u201d lower than the Cayenne and the rear split folding seats allow for 53 cubic feet of cargo when laid down and 17.7 cubic feet when upright.\nThe new Macan is a breath of fresh air in the growing market segment and offers a multitude of amenities for all buyer types. Just prepare for price adjustments when you outfit your vehicle with the long list of available options.",

I was estranged from my own mother at the time and still am. Every person in my family either lost a mother early or was abandoned by them. I feel like I have no one earthly to turn to for encouragement and support. My patron saint is St. Anna, the mother of our Mother and I have wept so many nights asking for her intercession. Our society really does not honor the struggles mothers go through, and instead focuses on the utopian picture painted by Hallmark and so many parenting magazines. Mothers are broken, and flawed, we get angry and say things we shouldn't. The Church understands that we are imperfect parents and offers the salve for our wounded spirits. I have always loved our faith, but I never truly, deeply, madly in love with it until I had my children. The support and tradition of our faith was like a life preserver during the most unstructured time of my life. My husband is not Orthodox so sometimes I feel like I am carrying the light in my own, but if it's for my kids I am happy to carry it.

Many have advised me to visit jackson market and go for an American or a Japanese Shimano Cycle. But Jackson Market is very far away and quite unsafe, I prefer any place within the city.\nAny Mountain Byc would also work. Please suggest for Karachi....\nBhai g, upgrade your self...shift to bike now...its been 30 yrs. yaaar....\nolx..sab kuch bickta hai....check it out...loads of shimano cycles for sale there\nThanks, but olx has a lot of jaali cycles. As far as Motorbycs are concerned, I need a bicycle, not a motorcycle....\nkash humari country mein Trek bicycles ati hoti . Kamal chhez hai Carbon fibre ki bike the most light in weight and but solid then steel!! Trek Bicycle Corporation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nWiasay BMX ya pheonix mein ki aissue hai ?\nSee this and PM me\nDear All,\nAs I asked a lot of people about the cycle purchase, I have bought one for myself from Jackson Market for Rs 19,000. It is half South African and half Japanese. It just feels great, I am loving the ride and enjoying. Cycle enthusiasts in Karachi areas like Gulshan, F.B. Area, North Nazimabad are all invited to forma club wheeby we may organize cycling events in these areas on weekends. Or maybe go to some other areas for longer routes...\nVery nice cycle..\nI have been to jackson market this month.... No offense but you paid a hell lot of money for this. Im not saying the bike isnt good......Its really good.....but you paid alot of money. Bargaining keri thi ya nahi......sach sach batana bhai?\ndear Aximaxim..Can u give an idea of prices of similar cycles at jackson? I am planning to purchase one decent gear cycle..\nSent from my HTC Desire S using PW Forums mobile app\nMarida is a good brand but the size you got is small and suitable for a person of height not more than 5f 6in.You paid a little more for this bike. The price range for this bike must between 10k?13k. It has nice rims.\nBut price doesn't matter as far as you are enjoying a trouble free ride.\nSent from my GT-I9300 using Tapatalk 2\nSomewhere around 10k from Jackson Market\nI purchased one genuine japnese shimano from jackson 2 years back for rs.5600 and at that time i was getting an extraordinary american cycle for not more than 9k and my japnese cycle is still as smooth as it was two years back 19k u made the day of that seller bro u shoud have negotiated in an hardcore manner ...\ni am also looking for a used cycle.. with shocks and springs.. but in a far more manageable price @ali040 want to sell that shimano? is it with or without shocks?\nusman bhai remember shook ke koi umer nhe hote na he koi sawari. If any body wants to ride cycle he should must do cycling. Even if any body wants to take taste of rakshaw he should also ride it remember it doesn't mean k woh rakshaw chalane ko apna future bna le I am just saying for to just take a taste. Agar koi quad bike bike chalana chahta hai he should also ride it and like that go on and on to full fill taste on everyride he wants to. I am having two bike and a car phir bhe sath aik mountain bike with gears shifting rakhe hue hai still. Look at china even rich people don't hesitate to ride cycle there yehe hai china ke progress ka raz bhe k sharam cycle chalne mei nhe hote na he koi chota kam krne mei.\nBro looking nice. You have got a good thing but at higher price at this price you can get an famous bikes like bmx or giant. But if you are enjoying it then forget the price quota and enjoy it as more as you can. Btw where you live..?\nSent from my iPhone using PW Forums mobile appYahoo i got the app at last...!\nMine is without shocks ...... and sorry dude for selling that ..... i wont ...\nFriends can anyone tell me that from where i can have used but genuine japnese or american tyres front and rear for my shimano bicycle in KARACHI !!! hoping to get a suitable advice\nDear Friend, I roamed around Jackson twice and this was the best bargain that I got. We were two people, my other friend bought a racer for 32k. Prices have shot up. You'll know after survey. I had the options between 9k 13k as well, but this bicycle really stood out, as you ride it, one can feel the difference k Yes its a different experience byc. My personal budget while going there was 12k max. but I still managed to get it in 19k as I loved the byc, very light weight and since my height is 5 7, the byc really suited me. I agree you'll get cheaper options, but then again you will be trading some defect with it. mine is clean sweep, just buy and ride kinda stuff.",

    "context": " that someone\u2019s perception of any given situation shaped their reality. In that sense, the saying is true. BUT, we\u2019ve let things get waaaaay out of hand. In this article, we\u2019ll uncover how the notion, \u201cPerception IS reality,\u201d is gravely dangerous. We\u2019ll dive in to its inherent laziness, and we\u2019ll work to undo the damage caused by its insane overuse.\nThis week I had a cool opportunity to speak with our summer bridge student-athletes. I was pumped! Student-athlete development is all kinds of all up in my wheelhouse. The topic, however, had me feeling out of my comfort zone and in over my head.\n\u201cMaking Tough Decisions\u201d was to be presented to a room full of football and basketball players. How was I, the women\u2019s golf coach, going to relate to student-athletes who play totally different sports. Team sports instead of an individual sport. Team sports with large rosters instead of a small roster. Team sports with large rosters at a time when they were exhausted from the day\u2019s activities AND hungry.\nAll of that to say \u2014 I was nervous. But then something really cool happened. We used laughter as a common denominator and from all corners of the room people allowed themselves to be authentically vulnerable. TOUCHDOWN! I was grinning ear to ear.\nThe discussion was frank, honest, REAL, and folks were totally engaged. And even amongst all the realness that \u201cMaking Tough Decisions\u201d in college might provoke (yes, they went there) \u2013 those student-athletes handled themselves with a level of maturity and sincerity that made me proud.\nIt was a gut-check moment for me as a leader. \u201cPerception is reality\u201d had planted all sorts of seeds of what this session was going to look like, feel like, and therefore be like. They were SUPPOSED to be tired, not really pay attention, and generally want to be anywhere other than in a room listening to the women\u2019s golf coach.\nSeth Godin would disapprovingly tell me that, \u201cI let myself off the hook\u201d by being lazy enough to assume that my perceptions would BE reality. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong \u2013 and, this night, it slapped me across the face in the best way possible.\nI learned a valuable lesson. A big ol\u2019 hat tip to the indescribably awesome student-athletes of June Summer Bridge 2017 for being the teachers in the room that night. Ain\u2019t it funny how things work out?\nPerception is NOT reality. It\u2019s just that \u2013 it\u2019s your perception of a given situation or encounter. YOUR perception that is clogged with preconceived notions, stereotypes, past experiences, thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and judgement. Perception is NOT reality. It's just that - your perception of a given situation or encounter. Click To Tweet\n\u201cPerception is Reality\u201d is Lazy:\nIt\u2019s a lazy thing to say and it\u2019s a lazy thing to believe. It let\u2019s you off the hook and gives you an excuse not to step in to someone\u2019s else\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s lazy because it\u2019s the EASY. WAY. OUT. It\u2019s lazy because the majority use it as a platitude to justify our thoughts.\nYou know like, \u201cWell, perception is reality,\u201d therefore I can go on being ignorant, intolerant or self-centered. It\u2019s harsh, I know. I\u2019m in the thick of it too \u2013 It\u2019s just as much for me as it is for anybody who may stop in and read this.\n\u201cPerception is Reality\u201d is Dangerous:\nIt\u2019s dangerous to use the phrase in a way that lets us off the hook. It\u2019s dangerous because it\u2019s toxic. When we use it to JUSTIFY in this manner it only serves to further reinforce those stereotypes, past experiences, thoughts, beliefs and judgements.\nY\u2019all, that\u2019s really scary! We perpetuate our own perceptions by peddling them out in to the world as reality \u2013 YIKES! We perpetuate our own perceptions by peddling them out in to the world as reality - YIKES! Click To Tweet\nIf we use this phrase around others it muddles their truth as well. The damage can be done exponentially. Lazy and dangerous is never a good combo. This, my good friends, is a cycle we need to work together to break.\nSolutions & A Real-Life Example In Action:\nIn the Leading Beyond Sport Facebook group this week (wait what? You haven\u2019t joined yet \u2013 it\u2019s cool just click here) one member wrote, \u201cWhen I get my feelings hurt [my challenge is] confronting the person who hurt them. I always tell myself maybe that person was having a bad day and didn\u2019t mean the way it came across \u2013 or that maybe I took it the wrong way. Dealing with hurt feelings\u2026.that\u2019s a process.\u201d\nI admire her for being candid enough to share this, and I really super duper admire that she acknowledges, \u201cmaybe that person was having a bad day and didn\u2019t mean it the way it came across \u2013 or maybe I took it the wrong way.\u201d That, in and of itself, is the solution.\nTo take those few extra seconds to consider the possibility that \u201cmaybe I took it the wrong way.\u201d Said differently (hang with me\u2026 here comes the #truth) \u201cmaybe my perception is NOT the reality.\u201d The gal that shared this is well on her way to processing those hurt feelings because she is brave enough to consider that maybe, just maybe, her feelings don\u2019t need to be hurt by this encounter.\nThat maybe she can go on loving that person because nothing inherently bad has happened \u2013 that maybe she assigned hurt feelings to herself because she let her perception become her reality. The consideration she shows in those few extra seconds \u2013 That\u2019s courageous ya\u2019ll.\nI\u2019m privileged to know this sweet lady and call her a friend. She possesses empathy like you can\u2019t imagine and that makes her a legit superhero in her field. I think we can all learn a lil somethin\u2019 from her wise words that she shared with deep vulnerability and deeper beauty.\nPerception is NOT reality. Reality is reality \u2013 and we don\u2019t get to be the judge of that. Let\u2019s work hard not to confuse the two.\nReflection:\nWhen have you used \u201cPerception is Reality\u201d to let yourself off the hook by not putting yourself in somebody else\u2019s shoes?

    "context": "Breaking Down Roberto Di Matteo's Influence on Chelsea's ResurgenceOctober 5, 2012\nChelsea heads into its match with Norwich City on Saturday atop the Premier League table, three points clear of second place after six games. It's just the latest sign of success under manager Roberto Di Matteo, who has transformed the Blues since taking over.\nOne debate that has raged on for as long as sports have existed is the overall impact of a coach or manager. Some analysts would argue their impact is minimal while others would say they are crucial to success, and, in reality, the answer is likely somewhere in between the two extremes.\nYet, it's impossible to look at the Chelsea situation and discount the job Di Matteo has done to turn the storied club back into a top European contender despite not having a large roster overhaul since taking the reigns from Andre Villas-Boas.\nThe 42-year-old Italian took over last March on an interim basis with the team out of form and destined to finish the campaign in disappointing fashion. Chelsea had won just one of its last seven matches and were on the brink of Champions League elimination.\nEverything changed in the blink of an eye. Suddenly the Blues were playing with more confidence and energy, and the results showed followed suit. It was almost like an entirely different team was taking the field all of a sudden.\nChelsea won its first four games under the guidance of Di Matteo, including a stunning Champions League comeback against Napoli, a match that was the first clear sign something special was going on Stamford Bridge.\nFootball fans around the globe know what happened from there. Chelsea completed an amazing run in the Champions League, knocking off Benfica, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and also lifted the FA Cup by defeating Liverpool.\nThe surprising late-season charge begs one question: How did Di Matteo get his players to turn off a dead-end road and back on the path to championships so quickly?\nTaking over a team in the middle of a season is extremely difficult. Players have spent months adapting to a certain style and it's virtually impossible to make significant changes in the midst of so many league and tournament games.\nThat's where Di Matteo's brilliance came into play. The former midfielder knew he was going to have to work with the pieces that were already in place, led by veterans like Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and John Terry.\nInstead of making radical changes he simply shifted the team's outlook. He imposed on the Blues a level of confidence that was sorely lacking under his predecessor, using motivation as way to get the players to play at or above their expected level of performance.\nNo player is a better example of that than Fernando Torres. The Spanish striker was in a deep, prolonged slump prior to Di Matteo taking charge at Chelsea, going a span of 22 matches without scoring a goal. He looked completely lost in situations when he used to thrive.\nTwo weeks after Di Matteo too over, he notched two goals and two assists in a game against Leicester City. He added five more goals before season's end, including a key tally against Barca to ensure Chelsea would advance to the Champions League final.\nIt happened throughout the squad as if better form was contagious and everybody was catching it. Drogba turned back the clock, becoming a dominant force in key moments. Goalkeeper Petr Cech made huge saves left and right like a brick wall between the posts.\nThe players didn't change, but their belief in themselves and the team did. Di Matteo forced them to think they could compete with the top teams in Europe and jumping that mental hurdle ahead of time is often just as important as the matches.\nAs this season began, the biggest concern was whether Di Matteo could carry any of that magic over to a fresh campaign. While it's still very early, the results would point toward a resounding yes, making the decision to give him the manager spot look like a genius move.\nUltimately, the players are the ones who win or lose games. But after watching Chelsea's resurgence since March, you'd be hard-pressed to develop an argument that Di Matteo hasn't had a major impact on the rapid turnaround.\nHe's done a tremendous job, but now comes the tough part of living up to the hype. While only time will tell if he can do that, Chelsea and its supporters are certainly riding high right now.",

    "context": "Pausing for reflection at the end of the year, I thought I would reveal the most popular posts from this blog on interfaith identity, interfaith parenting, interfaith children, interfaith families, and interfaith life. Below is a list of the top ten most-viewed posts since this blog began in 2009. In the comments, let me know which posts were your personal favorites of all time, and what topics you would like to see covered in the year to come.\n- Ten Reasons to Teach Interfaith Children Both Religions. It seems fitting that the number-one post on this site is devoted to explaining the benefits of exploring both family religions with dual-faith children.\n- Advent, Christmas, Hanukkah, Welcome Yule! Interfaith Families Doing the Most. This post includes vignettes from my family celebrating each of these holidays. It was selected by WordPress for their \u201cFreshly Pressed\u201d feature. It also benefited from traffic based on the provocative public letter addressed to me by a blogger for the Jewish Daily Forward who objects to intermarriage.\n- Welcome Walker Diggs, Interfaith Child. Fans of intermarried Broadway and television stars Idina Menzel (Jewish and white) and Taye Diggs (Christian and black) have kept this post at the top of the hit list. When their baby son Walker was born, I wondered in this post how they would choose to raise him in terms of religion. The last I read, the couple is still figuring out their religious pathway for Walker.\n- Interfaith Marriage: A Love Story. The post describing the long and happy marriage of my Jewish father to my Christian mother has become a perennial favorite on this blog. When they celebrated their 50th anniversary, I wrote about how their successful interfaith marriage has made it impossible for me to feel that intermarriage is a bad idea. Readers are scouring the internet, looking for signs of happy interfaith couples. The popularity of this post inspired me to start a whole series on successful interfaith marriages.\n- Muslim and Jewish: Interfaith on \u201cShahs of Sunset.\u201d Okay, so this post is popular because of a trashy reality TV series, featuring wealthy Jews and Muslims of Persian (Iranian) descent misbehaving in Los Angeles. Fans trying to figure out which character is Muslim, which is Jewish (and which is from an interfaith Muslim/Jewish family) end up on my blog. Intermarriage between Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews and Christians represents the next wave of multi-faith families. So I am glad the interfaith world beyond Judaism and Christianity is represented in my top-ten posts.\n- Roger Williams, My Bat Mitzvah, and the \u201cLively Experiment.\u201d I adore the fact that this tribute to a 17th-century religious rebel in New England remains a top post on my site. Roger Williams founded what would eventually become Rhode Island as a refuge for Quakers, Jews, Anabaptists, and anyone fleeing the religious oppression of Massachusetts Puritans. Williams himself ended up becoming a very early example of the \u201creligious nones,\u201d without institutional religious affiliation.\n- Black and Jewish, Interfaith and Interracial, Hilarious and Offensive. A parody music video created by two pop culture stars who are black and Jewish inspired this post. It represents a pushback against the idea that Jews are by definition white, and a reminder of the rise of racial and religious intermarriage in our increasingly multicultural world.\n- Successful Interfaith Marriages Ignored Once Again. This post critiques a Washington Post opinion piece that described interfaith marriages as doomed to frequent failure. The author is affiliated with a conservative think tank, and was fired this year from a blogging position at the Chronicle for Higher Education over a post described by some as racist. People searching for news of successful interfaith marriages stumble on this post, and I am glad that responding to an anti-intermarriage piece provided me with an opportunity to connect with more readers and bring them news of happy intermarriages.\n- Celebrating Martin Luther King: Multiracial, Multifaith in the 21st Century. This post in honor of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday refers to his relationship with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who marched alongside King. I go on to describe how my community of interfaith families, composed of intermarried Jews and Christians, and intermarried blacks and whites, celebrates King\u2019s birthday holiday and the Civil Rights movement.\n- Interfaith Children: Born This Way. I wrote this post to respond to the blogger who was dismayed by the idea that my family celebrates both Christmas and Hanukkah. While making reference to Lady Gaga\u2019s anti-bullying campaign and her hit song \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d I describe how children from interfaith families benefit from claiming our interfaithness and discovering all that is positive about bridging two religions and two cultures. I am glad the idea that families can and should instill pride rather than shame in their interfaith children, made it into the top ten posts.\nSusan Katz Miller\u2019s book, Being Both: Embracing Two Religions in One Interfaith Family is available now in hardcover and eBook from Beacon Press.\nAdvertisements",

    "context": "A while back, I asked my readers to Spin Me A Yarn about their personal crochet journey. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing you to Karen from:\nKaren Lynne Beads.\nKaren has chosen to tell us about something she\u2019s working on right now. Without any further distraction from me, here\u2019s Karen!\nHi! My name is Karen.\nI\u2019ve been crocheting since I was about 8. I think that\u2019s right. Over forty years. I figure I\u2019ve got this down pretty good.\nAs I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the idea, I decided to teach myself Tunisian crochet. Looked at BLOGs, watched some u-tube videos, bought the funny looking hook. I finally sat down and started to Tunisian crochet. Did a small sample and decided this wasn\u2019t too bad. So, I grabbed some yarn from my stash and set out to make a scarf.\nYou know what? I hate this stitch. The scarf is wider then the sample was, and I\u2019m running into the problem of how do you hold the hook? If I hold it where I usually do, then my fingers are in the way of the yarn on the hook. If I hold it farther down, it\u2019s all awkward. And the stitches are not consistent. They are loose on the two ends, but too tight in the middle.\nAnd it CURLS!!! What is up with that?\nI\u2019ve done about six inches. That\u2019s not long enough for a scarf. It\u2019s done in acrylic yarn so, even if I could get it to lie flat, it wouldn\u2019t make a very good pot holder.\nRibbet!\nKaren\u2019s Creation!\nThank you so much, Karen, for sharing with me and my readers! Personally, I think it looks pretty good! I\u2019m not sure how to make it stop curling though.\nAnyone know how to help Karen with Tunisian crochet? If you have any suggestions, please share them in the comments and be sure to let Karen know how much you enjoyed reading her yarn.\nIf you\u2019re interested in spinning a yarn for us, visit my Spin Me A Yarn post to learn how you can be featured in an interview here at Imperial Crochet.\nThanks for posting my story, Robin. I had fun writing this for you.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nIt was my pleasure Karen. Thank you so much! I appreciate it.\nOh no! I love Tunisian crochet! Don\u2019t give up on it. It does tend to curl but there are ways to fix that. Ironically, I just made some sleeves for a coat that I\u2019m working on using Tunisian crochet. I hate the sleeves but not because of the Tunisian crochet. I picked the wrong color and it doesn\u2019t work. And I agree that your attempt looks lovely and looks as it should look. There are different ways to hold the hook to make it less awkward. I should probably post more about this style of crochet. I think I will. \ud83d\ude42\nLikeLiked by 4 people\nYes, please do post more about Tunisian crochet, Yolanda! I\u2019m curious about it myself. Thanks for stopping by!\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nIt has occurred to me that if I was a knitter, I night find holding the hook with yarn all over it more comfortable.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nYou might be on to something there, Karen. I tried knitting years and years ago. I prefer crochet but maybe I should try knitting again. I see so many beautiful things being knitted lately.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nI learned to knit when I learned to crochet. Haven\u2019t knit since then. I think it was too complicated for 8 year old Karen.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nMy experience with Tunisian crochet is that it does tend to curl unfortunately. It\u2019s worth sticking with though! There are a lot of pretty stitches that you can learn and you\u2019ll find a way to hold the hook that works in time.\nLikeLiked by 2 people\nThank you for sharing your thoughts Hayley!\nNice post! This is one of the reasons why I don\u2019t bother with tunisian it was all curly \ud83d\ude26\nLikeLiked by 2 people\nI\u2019ve never tried it. Not sure if I want to anymore.\nI have always wanted to try Tunisian crochet. The swatch looks great (hopefully a little blocking will relax the curling?) \ud83d\ude42\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nOh, that\u2019s a great idea! I never think of blocking.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThe Tunisian curls!! I thought when I first learned Tunisian that I was doing something wrong \u2013 it\u2019s just one of those things. Try using a larger hook size. My biggest mistake was not knowing that for Tunisian you should go up at least one size larger than what the yarn recommends. There are other Tunisian techniques that aren\u2019t as curly \u2013 Entrelac is lovely and doesn\u2019t curl. It\u2019s definitely a nice technique to add to your repertoire! Love the \u201cYarn\u201d you spun! \ud83d\ude00\nLikeLiked by 2 people\nThanks for sharing some great tips Tami!\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nI read an article that recommended using a chainless foundation to begin a Tunisian project. I did try this and the curling was eliminated!\nLikeLiked by 1 person\nThank you for sharing Crocheted Butterfly!",

I do this so that I can check my stash and keep an eye out for deals on items for specific people.\nMy husband comes from a large family. Many of them do not see or speak to each other, which makes holidays difficult. We feel obligated to purchase gifts for them, as they always send gifts to us. The problem? They struggle dearly and we do not. We bargain shop, and they do not. I feel terrible about someone who cannot afford it purchasing my child a $25 gift when I pay a few pennies for theirs, even if the gifts I purchase are worth hundreds. What\u2019s worse is that just a couple of us get together, so gifts are handed down at gatherings until they eventually make it to the intended party- months later.\nThe hubby says that we should only purchase for one of his nephews (they are very close). Of course, he\u2019ll change his mind between now and then if the rest of the family doesn\u2019t jump on board. Skipping in-law gifts will knock 16 names off of my list. At the $5 limit I set for myself, that\u2019s only $80, but if it keeps the rest of the family from spending $400, it\u2019s worth it.\nI don\u2019t like to see everyone else struggling to make ends meet and spending a fortune on gifts for my kids. I don\u2019t mind to spend it on them, but I want to know NOW!\nDo you guys have any ideas? Is this a problem for your family?\nI don\u2019t like drawing names and setting limits, because in order for me to hit a spending limit, one child will receive substantially more gifts than another. And, one sister holds the majority of the kids, so many that she would be purchasing for her own if names were drawn.\nThis is a good year to cut back for everyone; the economic downturn can be your scapegoat. One side of our family has stopped buying Christmas gifts entirely, but instead buy for birthdays so that it's spread throughout the year. We still get together and enjoy a huge meal, but now put the focus on being together and remember the Reason for the season. Another side of the family has started choosing a couple of families from the Share Your Christmas tree and buying for them instead. It makes everyone feel great to know we're helping someone less fortunate. By doing this, we're only buying for our immediate family (spouse & kids)\u2026.sure works for us!\n[Reply]\nI have to agree with K2save. Times are tough for all most everyone and Christams has become so commericalized anymore that many people tend to forget the real reason for the season. We buy for our most immediate family and for our parent's I send a money order made payable to the electric company as well one for their favorite store so if there is something they actually \"need\" they can get it (ie\u2026groceries,prescriptions or those incidentials that we all use) One could also put together food baskets for family members that are struggling and perhaps a small toy for the child/children. It feels good to give and it does comes back to those that give with a open loving heart\n[Reply]",
    "question": "What is the writer's concern about buying Christmas gifts for their extended family?",
    "answer": "The writer is concerned about the financial disparity between their family and their extended family. They feel uncomfortable that their less fortunate relatives spend a significant amount on gifts for them, while they themselves bargain shop for gifts. They are also concerned about the logistics of gift distribution, as gifts often reach the intended recipients months later due to infrequent family gatherings.",

There are several authentic versions of the Tashahhud and the Sunnah is to diversify between reciting them so that the person revives the sunnah and follows the Prophet sallah Allahu \u2018alayhi wassalam. This also takes away from boredom due to repetition of reciting the same one which can lead to neglecting the meaning of what the person is reciting.\nWe will go over one version in which is the following:\nAt-Tahiyaatu Lilah wa Salawatu wa Tayibaat, Assalamu \u2018Alaika Ayuha Nabi wa Rahmatu Allahi wa Barakatu, Assalamu \u2018Alayna wa \u2018ala \u2018eebadu Allahu Saliheen. Ashadu an La ilaaha illa Lah, wa ashadu ana Muhammedan \u2018Abdahu wa Rasulu.\nAllahumma salli \u2018ala Muhammed wa \u2018ala aali Muhammed. Kama sallaytah \u2018ala Ibrahim wa \u2018ala aali Ibrahim, Innaka Hameedun Majeed. Wa barak \u2018ala Muhammed wa \u2018ala aali Muhammed. Kama Barakta \u2018ala Ibrahim, wa \u2018ala aali Ibrahim wa \u2018ala aali Ibrahim, Innaka Hameedun Majeed.\nAnd this means:\nSalutations (which is the linguistic meaning), magnification, dominion, Kingship, freedom from all evils and any imperfection, benedictions, bowings and prostrating too, existence (all of these terms belong in the meaning of At-Tahiyaat) all belongs to Allah. All good deeds (at-Tayyibaat) belong to Allah. I invoke Allah to bestow safety upon the Prophet sallah Allahu \u2018alayhi wassalam and to render him safe from every derogatory evil and the Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you. I invoke Allah to bestow safety and security upon myself and for the righteous slaves of Allah subhanahu wa ta\u2019ala. I testify and bear witness that there is no true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah, and I testify that Muhammed is the slave and messenger of Allah.\nOh Allah have Your praise upon the Prophet Muhammed, and upon the household of Muhammed (the household here is referring to Bani Hashim, Bani Mutalib and his wives).as you praised Ibrahim and the household of Ibrahim (the household of Ibrahim are the believers from his offspring and from them are the prophet \u2018alayhum assalatu wassalam and the best of them is Muhammed sallah Allahu \u2018alayhi wassalam). Verily, Your are the Praised and Glorified. And grant Muhammed and the household of Muhammed the honor and reverence as you granted Ibrahim and the household of Ibrahim. Verily, Your are Praised and Glorified.\nIt is important to understand this because this will help the musalli to establish khusu\u2019 (sincerity) because he will contemplate its meaning while he recites it making his prayer more proper.\nThis is what is known as At-Tahiyaat\nAfter you recite this you make an important du\u2019aa which is the following:\nAllahumma inni a\u2019uthu bika min al-\u2018athab Al-Jahannum wa min al-\u2018athab al-kaber wa min fitnati al-mahya wal mamat wa min al-fitnahtah al-Masi7u Ad-Dajjal.\nThis means:\nOh Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of Hellfire and the torment of the grave and the torment of the life and death and the trials and tribulations from the Pseudo-Christ.\nSome of the salaf are of the opinion that this du\u2019a is obligatory.\nAfter reciting this, the person may choose from what he wishes and what he likes from the good of this life and the good of the hereafter before concluding the sallah. However, it is recommended to say that which came from the Prophet sallah Allahu \u2018alayhi wassalam who recommended Mu\u2019adth Bin Jabal to say::\nAllahummah a\u2019inni \u2018ala thikrik wa shukrik wa husni \u2018eebadatik.\nThis means:\nOh Allah help me to remember You and to thank you and in the good conduction of worship to You.\nThe person may also say:\nAllahumma inni thalamtu nafsi thulman katheera wala yaghfiru thanuba illa Ent. Faghfirli maghfiratan min \u2018Indik, warhamni innaka Enta Al-Ghafouru Al-Raheem.\nOh Allah I have indeed oppressed my soul excessively and none can forgive them except You, so forgive me a forgiveness from Yourself and have mercy upon me. Verily, You are the Most-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful.\nThe Prophet sallah Allahu \u2018alayhi wassalam taught this du\u2019a to Abu Baker radi Allahu ta\u2019ala \u2018anhu as stated in the agreed upon hadith.\nTaken from understand-islam.net",

    "context": "Anyone who\u2019s ever smoked marijuana has no doubt had the experience of violently coughing after taking a hit. But why does this only happen at some times and not others? And when you cough after a toke, does it really make you higher, as stoner-legend has it? We\u2019ve got the facts for you.\nWhy Does Weed Make You Cough?\nThe most obvious reason is that your lungs just aren\u2019t designed to breathe in smoke. Smoke of any kind \u2014 including marijuana smoke \u2014 consists of microscopic stable, liquid particles. These particles irritate the lungs and make it harder for your body to breathe. As a result, your brain signals your lungs to start coughing to expel these foreign objects so that normal breathing can be restored.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, this effect can be tempered with experience. Your lungs are incredibly adaptive, and they can be \"trained\" to cough less (or not at all, if you\u2019re a seasoned smoker). That\u2019s why your first time smoking cannabis almost certainly involved a lot of coughing \u2014 and why, for many, that effect lessens over time.\nCan't Take The Heat\nHeat also plays a significant role in making you cough after taking a hit. Smoking gets you high because the intense heat \"activates\" the the psychoactive chemical in the plant (THC). This activation allows the THC to quickly get into your bloodstream so that you feel the effects.\nA byproduct of this intense heat is lung irritation. Your lungs and their sensitive tissues are easily irritated by the hot smoke, which causes you to cough. That\u2019s why using a water pipe, such as a bong, is so effective at reducing coughing: The water cools down the smoke before it enters your lungs. Putting ice cubes in your bong can make that effect even stronger.\nAlso, any smoker knows that if you take a rip too big for you, then you\u2019ll start coughing. The more lung capacity you have, the more smoke your lungs can hold. Like a balloon, your lungs can only hold so much. If you over-fill a balloon, it pops. Your lungs, on the other hand, are forced to expel the smoke in another way: coughing. That\u2019s why getting too confident with your hit size can lead to a coughing fit.\nAdvertisement\nLastly, the quality of your product has a significant effect on how likely it is to make you cough. An unfortunate reality is that less-than-reputable cannabis is often grown with pesticides and other additives, in addition to any dust or mildew that may have found its way into your stash. These things in and of themselves are irritating to your lungs, and exposing yourself to them will increase your risk of coughing.\nBut if you\u2019re looking to get blasted, do you actually want to be coughing?\nDoes Coughing Make You Higher?\nThis question may be as old as the plant itself. Many stoners claim that if you cough from smoking, you\u2019ll get higher than if you don\u2019t. The prevailing theory is that coughing expands the lungs, which results in more surface area being exposed to the smoke.\nBut in reality, the lungs are expanding due to a forceful inhalation of air followed immediately by a cough. That's letting out all the smoke in your lungs. Since it\u2019s the smoke that gets you high, and coughing quickly rids you of the smoke, it follows that coughing wouldn\u2019t make you more high at all.\nThe reason it may seem that way is that just before you coughed, you probably took in more smoke than your lungs could hold. So even though you coughed the smoke back out, taking such a massive hit would still result in getting somewhat intoxicated. In short, taking a huge hit is what causes both the coughing and the feeling of being extra high, rather than the coughing bringing about a sense of being extra high in and of itself.\nAdvertisement\nBasically, the best way to maximize your intake would be to take as big of a hit as your body will allow without causing you to cough.\nRead These Stories Next:\n(Refinery29 in no way encourages illegal activity and would like to remind its readers that marijuana usage continues to be an offense under Federal Law, regardless of state marijuana laws.

At the time she and Steven were still continuing their gig at Amazon for several more weeks. But they took an early out and their first stop is right here!\nA quick happy hour at our place gets us caught up on Wednesday evening, and we make plans for the next day.\nThursday morning Linda picks Tessa and I up for some shopping, and later Bill and Steven head into Memphis to see the new movie Arrival.\nSharing this amazing life with people whose company we really enjoy is a blessing - even just doing normal stuff :-) We found everything we were looking for, and the guys enjoyed what they both called a mind-bending film.\nLinda shows me how to cook a roast in my Instant Pot while she whips up a cheesecake to bake in hers. We've named them Thelma and Louise and look forward to sharing their individual adventures and their reunions down the road.\nThe roast is amazing, and I am immediately inspired to do lots of cooking in the new Pot. We'll see..... :-)\nOne more place I really want to see is the National Civil Rights Museum, so Friday I make a solo trip back across the river to Memphis. Since it is at the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was killed I expect to be moved. Since I worked for the union 26 years I expect to feel a connection. Since I don't know everything I expect to learn a lot.\nThis museum is exceptionally well done. At the end of the powerful opening film narrated by proud, not-apologizing-for-my-anger young African Americans, the screen rolls back and I follow the moving silhouettes of marching protesters into the exhibits.\nI spend three hours here and in no way can I capture in words or photos the impact. All the expectations yes. Definitely. But something very unexpected as well. Sadness. And the reality that if I had visited one month earlier it would have been pride instead. I can't help but feel that in one day we went from seeing our country realize the dreams of thousands who fought and died for civil rights, to a frightening U-turn.\nFortunately we have a birthday celebration on Friday evening that lifts my spirits and reminds me we are surrounded by really great people.\nIt's Steven's birthday and the four of us have a lovely time full of enlightened discussion, belly laughs, and amazing food.

I'm glad you had that wonderful time with friends to to balance things back out.\nWith the Kennedys and Dr King, it was such a part of our lives :-(\nI remember race riots in Minneapolis in the 1960s. I wish there was no longer a reason for them.\nWe tried to visit the museum at the lunch counter in Greensboro, NC, but we they hadn't finished building it yet. I'm glad these site are being restored and turned into museums; this is a part of our history that needs to be remembered--not repeated.\nI agree, we are less likely to repeat when we remember :-))\nWow...what an emotional day, Jodee. Great post, indeed.\nThanks Jim :-))\nYour words about the National Civil Rights Museum nearly bring me to tears. This is a place I have really wanted to visit. I so share your fear that we are turning around all of the environmental and civil rights progress so many have fought so hard to achieve in the past 50 years. So so very hard won and how easily and quickly it can just be ripped away. It breaks my heart. So glad you had such obviously wonderful friends. Really want to hear about how you use the instant pot and whether a vegan would have any use for it.\nThank you Sherry, I know you'd enjoy the museum - so much we were never taught in school. I've been eating a \"mostly\" plant based diet for several weeks now and all the recipes I have to try this week are vegan. I'll let you know how they go, and where I got them.\nOutstanding post, Jodee! I'm sorry we didn't make it a point to stop at the museum. Thanks so much for your very moving narrative as you toured the exhibits. You did a great job sharing with us:)\nSounds like a special time with your friends. Love your Instant Pot buddies!!! I checked out Steve's photography...Wow!! Love his photo of Mesa Arch at sunrise...spectacular!\nThanks Pam, you must see it when you get back there. So glad you saw Steven's work, he amazes me. His book on Alaska is beyond wow!\nWe had sooo much fun with you guys in West Memphis! What luck that it worked out for our paths to cross again. The cooking sesh with Thelma and Louise was inspiring, so glad you were around to be testers with us. You have inspired me to make the effort to go to the Civil Rights museum next time we are in the area. This was not the time, too much mental decompression necessary after the Amazon gig...but, next time!\nI think you guys will appreciate the museum - it is exceptional.

Oh well.\nThe NZSA Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry has gone to Selina Tusitala Marsh for Fast Talking PI (AUP). Congratulations Selina!\nThe shortlist for the Best Poetry Book is a Mainland affair \u2013\n- Bernadette Hall for The Lustre Jug (VUP),\n- Michael Harlow for The Tram Conductor\u2019s Blue Cap (AUP),\n- and Brian Turner for Just This (VUP).\nAnd poets have taken over the Fiction category too:\n- Fiona Farrell, Limestone (Vintage)\n- Owen Marshall, Living as a Moon (Vintage)\n- Alison Wong, As the Earth Turns Silver (Penguin).\nAn interesting selection. I have all three of the poetry books, so shall have to sit down and reread them. I don\u2019t have Selina\u2019s book, although it\u2019s been on my books-to-investigate list for a while now.\nI think though that it\u2019s a pity they don\u2019t have a shortlist for Best First Book \u2013 and not just because it might have given me hope for a few months longer (I\u2019ll though I\u2019ll admit an element of that \u2026 sigh!). But it would have been interesting to know who made the shortlist, and who else was considered. Something to talk about. An acknowledgement that there was more than one book in the running. On the other hand, it does mean that three first time authors get an extra two month of celebrating \u2026\nSo, who do you think should win? Do any of the choices surprise you? Please you? Irritate you? And what is it about the South Island that produces so many fabulous writers?\nSorry you didn\u2019t make it babe \u2013 I mean, Joanna. Well done the Mainland, though, and huge ups for your generous post.

Will have to put it on the pile now.\nI agree with you about no shortlist for the new poets: I really think that\u2019s a fizz, especially as it was the new poets that I enjoyed reading and interviewing most last year.\nI will keep my fingers crossed that the Mary Gilmore Prize in Aus comes through for you and The Summer King\u2013and most deservedly imho.\nI also am very sad about the demise of the best first book shortlists. I\u2019d only just really noticed their existence, and they were gone again. I thought they were a really nice way of giving a bit extra attention to a few newer writers. The whole awards seems such a pinched affair this year, with only four categories and not many books in each.\nSorry that you didn\u2019t make the shortlist. There\u2019s no accounting for taste.\nI agree, too, that it would have been good to have a shortlist for Best First Book, it is great to have several new writers to explore. I enjoyed The Lustre Jug, but not as much as Bernadette\u2019s previous book, The Ponies \u2013 I could never fathom why that one missed the shortlist. I also have Michael Harlow\u2019s book but I haven\u2019t read Brian Turner\u2019s yet.

    "context": "Pressure. It can form beauty from the havoc in its surroundings.\nWe all face various forms of pressure in our lives. Work, traffic, family, it comes at us from all sides and, at times, seems never ending. We endure aspects of our lives that generate more pressure in the hopes of eventually finding an escape, a safe haven, from which we regain control.\nBecuase of this, it only seems logical that when we create a business, we work to avoid the pressures that assail us. We are building from our passions, an ideal we love, to create something more than what we have. No matter what the driving force is that pushes you forward, we all seek a common goal to some degree. To live in an environment we enjoy and control. Why then, would you invite pressure into that?\nIn nature, forces beyond what we can imagine influence our surroundings. Immense pressure from expanding gases pushed the molten rock to the surface to form exotic islands and majestic mountains. It is from these pressures that the beauty we seek to escape to comes.\nBut what about us? Our business? Do we not want to avoid those pressures we see as a hindrance in life?\nI was reading an article written by Benjamin P. Hardy, a postgraduate student studying Organizational Psychology, on Medium today when this excerpt caught my attention:.\nExploding Heads \u2013 It can get messy!\nAs mere mortals, when exposed to pressures we perceive at first to be insurmountable, we have two basic instincts that influence our actions \u2013 fight, or flight.\nFor a lot of people, when they see something that they are uncomfortable with confronting, the brain reacts by trying to push it away. We want our \u2018comfortable space\u2019 back again. When we over react, our mind goes into panic mode, and our head explodes. It makes a terrible mess as we make irrational choices to remove ourselves from the pressures being placed on us. And it doesn\u2019t end there!\nIn business, we are seen as the leaders of what we create. What do you think happens when others see your head explode? You got it, theirs does too! Now you have a group of people all standing around reacting to the choices you made, and the mess compounds.\nThere are two main groups you encounter at this point. The first run away!\nWhen they see your reactions, they take flight! They are out of there faster than a cop on a donut run! Or, they may stay, but you no longer have any real influence over their actions. You have shown them that you are not the leader they need. In either case, all the work/effort you have put in with them so far is . . . gone. Never to see any returns.\nThe second group? They are the \u2018rah-rah\u2019 crowd.\nThe ones that rush to tell you how they understand how hard it is, and that you made the \u2018right\u2019 choice too, basically, run away \u2013 back to that comfortable spot \u2013 again. This, in many ways, is the most insidious group. They prop up your decisions to not move beyond the problems and pressures, and remain where you are . . . forever.\nBut wait! There is a third (albeit much smaller) group lurking in the background.\nThese are the ones waiting to see if you suck it up \u2013 and overcome the obstacles \u2013 or, muck it up. Should you decide to stay and fight, they will be the ones that help you move forward. Achieve more. And become your best asset over time.\nOpportunities\nNo one ever moved forward by staying where they are. Not in business, not in life.\nIf you truly want to excel, move forward on your journey, then you must face the obstacles in your path head on. Forget flight, stand up and fight!\nSure, it may require you to take a step back, evaluate your options. Yes, it might even require you to admit you need help (it\u2019s not the end of the world, honest)! And although you must fight your battles alone, you have that \u2018third group\u2019 in your corner.\nOpportunities are there. Everyone gets them. But I have yet to see a single one worth doing walk up and say \u201cHere I am, I want to work on YOUR terms\u201d.\nYou have to do the work, prepare, take action, and drag that sucker back in screaming and kicking the entire time. No, it is NOT easy. Pressures like you can\u2019t even imagine now are probably in your future.\nIt\u2019s difficult, but not impossible. You can do this.\nPut your back against that proverbial wall, roll up your sleeves, and make things happen!\nThe choice, as always, is yours. Face the pressures, use them to build your mountain, and move forward. Or not, and find solace in telling the world how it was just \u2018too much\u2019 to undertake, and remain where you are.\n.\nWith Sincere Thanks\nRichard Taylor\n\u201cThe only limits we have are those you impose upon yourself. Remove the limits!\u201d\nFollow my current adventures on Twitter",

The transition between Manchester and death would be unnoticeable\u201d.\nFurious over care home news\nHilary Schofield of Churwell, daughter of Emma Jones resident of Siegen Manor.\nI WRITE further to your article about an under-staffed care home in Drighlington which has been placed into special measures by a health watchdog. (Morley Observer, September 21)i.\nThis is just what I need to read about on the day I found out through the press and media that Siegen Manor care home in Morley is set to be closed. My mum is 98 years old has been resident there for over 7 years she has been well cared for at all times, happy and very settled, she is frail, very poor sighted, deaf andhas vascular dementia.\nTo my knowledge there is two care homes in the Morley area that under special measures and others on improvements needed.\nSo well done to Leeds Adult Socail Care on there proposed closure of Siegan which is rated good on all aspects, how can we let this happen this can not be correct.\nI am so angry over plan to close I feel so strongly that the welfare and care does defiantly not belong in the private sector.\nBad news for abused women\nEileen Robottom, by email\nYou report (Yorkshire Evening Post, September 21) on efforts to tackle the appallingly high rate of domestic violence in the city. Coun Lisa Mulherin speaks of helping those affected to \u201caccess the support they need to help protect them and break away from their abuser if needed.\u201d\nYet breaking away depends on having somewhere else to go; and government policy is making this harder, and therefore putting more lives at risk.\nThe government claims it is protecting the future of domestic violence refuges by delaying until 2019 the capping of refuge residents\u2019 Housing Benefit to Local Housing Allowance Rates, and then introducing a new system of funding whereby the support element will be paid not from Housing Benefit but from a budget set by central government and to be administered by the Local Authority.\nSuch a plan means that the funding available is no longer determined by the level of need and is no longer a right for those who need it but will depend upon how much is in the pot.\nGiven the enormous financial pressures on the Local Authority, it is also likely that funding for domestic violence survivors from outside the Local Authority will be refused. This undermines a basic principle of refuge provision, the recognition that a survivor\u2019s safety may depend on being rehoused at a distance, in a place where they cannot be tracked down by the perpetrator.\nThe desperate shortage of social housing affects the safety of anyone seeking to flee domestic violence and family abuse. Social housing is being attacked on many flanks: forced sell offs of higher-value housing to pay for subsidies on housing association tenants\u2019 right to buy; replacement of social-rented homes in new developments by expensive \u201cstarter homes\u201d to buy; gaping holes left in the budgets of council and housing association providers by the compulsory 1% year-on-year rent cuts and by deep Housing Benefit Cuts which leave thousands literally unable to pay their rent. Until these policies are reversed, many of those affected by domestic violence will continue to be denied the right to live free of fear and to make a new life for themselves and their children.\nLibrary letter misses point\nIvan Kovaks, by email,\nI see Nick Keer has not been to a library for over 20 years, apart from a community forum meeting,\nHowever, clearly Mr Keer is only thinking of himself and his own situation and not that of others. His letter is littered with references to buying things . If you cannot afford to by the computer you could always use the free ones at the local library; but wait Mr Keer has closed them all!\nI agree with him about keeping up with new developments, but for many, who unlike him, cannot afford to buy so much, can only find the place to keep up all this is in the local library.\nA library is not just about books there are many other aspects such as club meetings and for many it is a social essential. These places are also used for many other community or hobby activities outside the regular opening hours.\nHe makes a good point about isolationism but for many, especially those less well off than him the place they go to avoid this is the local library. It looks like Mr Keer is advocating a technology induced isolationism and eventually becomes bereft of real human interaction.\nIt would be a tragedy\nDavid Gregson, Dewsbury\nIn reply to Mr Nick Keer `no tragedy if library closes`..\nLet\u2019s name a few The conversation group run by volunteers and is a vital social link for people who are isolated, hildrens book clubs, facilities provided for a local mental health support group run by volunteers, one of which is my mother who is in her 80s.\nThe local elderly support groups like WISE and libraries have offered their facilities for charity fundraising. Some libraries offer their training rooms at discount rates for charities and social care providers. Internet access is provided for everyone with extra services like training and job searching for those many people who have lost their jobs and are in a desperate situation.\nWorking as a carer on minimum wage and paying council tax there are many local services I dont use but I know we have a duty to provide them. Mr Keer yes it would be a tragedy for all libraries to close.\nCome out of isolation\nMike Weston, Morley\nSorry to see that Nick Keer admits to a potential life of isolation due to the Internet.\nThe simple answer would be to visit his local library. He will find real people having a great time. The Morley library is hosts to some of the Morley Arts Festival over the next two weeks. Other groups meet on a regular basis and this week the golden days group are supporting Macmillan cancer .\nThe children\u2019s library is a delight and up stairs the Morley History group are in regular attendance. I\u2019ve just collected two brand new books I ordered worth over \u00a340 at nil cost to me\nPlease Nick come in and try some or all of your local libraries and spread your wings.",

    "context": "When thinking of the composition of his roster, Rangers coach Alain Vigneault reiterated throughout training camp that \u201cmoney will be a factor.\u201d\nIn the hard-salary-cap world of the NHL, is has to be, especially for a big-market team like the Rangers with big-money contracts already on the books. But now that the preseason schedule has concluded and the next game is the regular-season opener Thursday night at the Garden against the Islanders, the Rangers are hoping to obtain something they so rarely have had in the recent past: roster flexibility.\nThe current group of 24 players on the books does include forward Oscar Lindberg, still on injured reserve. It leaves the Rangers with just over $2 million in space under the $73 million salary-cap ceiling. The amount of money they are under the cap each day accrues, so a penny saved today is one that can be used tomorrow \u2014 or at the Feb. 28 trade deadline.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely under the cap, but any more that we spend on a player not playing, we can use later on,\u201d Vigneault said after Saturday\u2019s practice at Chelsea Piers, having given his players off Sunday before returning Monday for three days of practice leading into the season opener.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the big picture,\u201d Vigneault added. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\nThe Blueshirts have $47.825 million annually locked up in eight players \u2014 Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist. (And imagine if captain McDonagh wasn\u2019t signed for such a club-friendly $4.7 million per season?) So eight players make up about 68 percent of the club\u2019s salary, and the other 15 players make up the remaining 32 percent. The lopsided nature is true on almost all NHL teams, leaving an onus on young, relatively cheap players to contribute in big roles.\nSo as much as Vigneault\u2019s ideal world contains a group with eight defensemen and 13 forwards, he knows it might not be the best scenario. If new defensemen Nick Holden and Adam Clendening are both scratched for the opener \u2014 which it seems they will be, barring a swing in opinion over the next few days of practice \u2014 they are still counting against the cap without playing. The decision then has to be made whether they\u2019re worth keeping around to not play while losing future cap flexibility.\nClendening would have to clear waivers to be sent down to AHL Hartford, while waiving Holden would likely mean the Rangers would lose him for nothing. Yet if 22-year-old Brady Skjei struggles early on, it might not be a short leash or short patience that gets him sent down without waivers, but the cap implications.\nThe biggest difference from years past is the level of uncertainty that remains with what the Rangers have. They don\u2019t know what to expect from Girardi coming off an awful season, preceded by so many good ones. Staal had a good camp, but is he back to being the aggressive and stout defenseman the team so desperately needs?\nThere is youth up front in Jimmy Vesey, Pavel Buchnevich and Mika Zibanejad, but how consistent can they be in carrying the offensive weight? Can Brandon Pirri keep scoring like he did in preseason, can Michael Grabner stay healthy and actually help the penalty kill, and can Josh Jooris be a steadying fourth-line center?\nThere are so many questions that can\u2019t be answered yet, and it does very little good to try to guess what will happen. Instead, Vigneault and the front office are waiting with somewhat bated breath to see exactly what they have.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that we might, for a short amount of time, until we sort things out, see different players in NHL competition. We might keep 23,\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not 100 percent sure yet.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not 100 percent sure because it\u2019s unknown just what kind of team the Rangers are right now. And when they find out, they want the financial ability to be able to change on the fly.",

    "context": "Going Faster By Going Slower\nThe title of this blog doesn\u2019t make sense. It seems to be a contradiction but let me explain. In the context of using your heart rate as a training tool, it was a critical element of getting faster.\nBefore I continue my story, let me give you some background. I began using a heart rate monitor for bicycling training back in 1992 and, believe it or not, I still have the same 20 year old Polar Pacer which still works quite well. I have had to buy several new transmitters but the receiver is the original. Back in 1992 this was a concept that was beginning to become popular for amateur bicycle racers including mediocre ones like me. The professional ranks in Europe were using this in the late 70\u2019s or early 80\u2019s but it became possible for the masses when the equipment became affordable. The idea which was helpful for me was the importance of taking days to rest and recuperate so that you could have faster \u201cfast\u201d days. What this means is essentially slow down if you want to go faster. On the slow days it is best to keep your heart rate at about 75% of your maximum heart rate which would be in the aerobic training zone and out of the anaerobic threshold which is roughly between 83% and 85%, depending on the individual. At the anaerobic threshold you begin to feel the \u201cburn\u201d of lactic acid in your muscles as you burn oxygen in your blood versus from the intake of your lungs.\nMy final race of any kind was in 1997 and I was past my prime then and had no appetite for finishing 10 minutes off the back after I had enjoyed the excitement of finishing at the front with the big boys. It was also after one too many wrecks and trips to the ER to get stitched up. As I gave up any thoughts of racing I still had the urge to go fast but gradually got busy with life and was not able to devote 12-14 hours per week on my bike. As I got older and slower I put away the transmitter for my heart rate monitor but always kept the receiver on the handlebar of my bike, like a reminder of my glory days (however minimal they were). By the mid 2000\u2019s I probably used it a couple times a year and just for a curiosity to see how far I had fallen. My days of using the heart rate monitor were long gone.\nLet\u2019s fast forward to a few weeks ago when an interesting reunion took place. I was struggling this year to explain why I did not seem to be able to make much progress with increasing my speed despite riding very regularly. It finally hit me \u2013 time to get out the heart rate monitor and begin to add some discipline to my training. As I suspected, the problem I was having was too much \u201cpedal to the metal\u201d which was wearing me out. I was not taking training days to recover and rest so I could get better. I needed to slow down to go fast.\nOver the past 3 weeks I have begun to get back into my old training regimen and have already noticed progress. I am going to add interval training to my weekly riding schedule this week to build some power now that I am adequately rested. I don\u2019t anticipate getting anywhere close to my previous condition but I am sure I will notice significant improvement within 6 or 8 weeks \u2013 if not sooner. I will keep you posted.\nHave a great week.",

    "context": "Sport Singapore will launch football academy for youth development\nSport Singapore to launch academy headed by the former Lion\nIn a major move that could be the start of something big for the game in the country, Sport Singapore yesterday announced it will launch a new football academy soon.\nThe ActiveSG Football Academy, which will be led by former national striker Aleksandar Duric, is a product of a close collaboration with the Football Association of Singapore (FAS).\nThe academy will focus on children from as young as eight and allow them to have fun while developing the right basic skills of the game.\nSpeaking before the launch of Duric's autobiography at Books Kinokuniya in Ngee Ann City, SportSG chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin said: \"We have recognised that there is a large potential pool of youths, boys and girls, who desire to play football.\n\"Many of them have not found the right place to play. For some of them, it may be less affordable or less accessible.\"\nMembership fees at the new academy, which will be based at five ActiveSG centres islandwide, are expected to be made affordable.\nFandi Ahmad's F-17 Academy charges $50 per session on top of a $50 annual membership fee, while a weekend session at the JSSL Arsenal Soccer School costs $40 plus a one-time registration fee of $100.\nHAND IN HAND\nThe academy will adopt the FAS grassroots manual as its core syllabus and the FAS coach education system to develop trainers.\nDuric, who spoke of his passion for working with kids, will also assemble a team of coaches and plan the academy's training programmes. It is understood that his appointment is seen as for the \"long haul\".\n\"We will definitely be working closely with FAS because we have the same goals to develop the youth in our country,\" said the 45-year-old.\n\"No better way than operating together and trying to open up a little more to kids who may be left out of the FAS programmes which do a little bit more elite-level things.\"\nThe academy will cater to different skill levels by training members in \"recreational competitive\" or at elite level.\n\"We recognise that not everybody is going to be an Aleks, but we're quite clear we'll find another Aleks,\" Lim said.\nWIDENING THE BASE\n\"If everybody was involved in one way or another, and specifically in this case, football, I think we will have more fans to start with.\"\nLim hopes the academy will contribute to a larger pool of players who are serious about football, paving the way for more competitions and leagues at various levels.\n\"We will have a market for more coaches and technical officials, and then eventually a strong youth system for our national youth teams. And if we get that right, a strong national team,\" he said.\nLim is also aiming for a good education off the pitch for the football hopefuls who are just starting out.\n\"We are thinking about making sure that we have a good quality programme that looks after not just football skills, but also transferable life skills,\" he said.\n\"So we hope that the kids\u2026 will take away the characteristics of having discipline, understanding what it means to work in a team and to have that fighting spirit.\"\n\u201cWe recognise that not everybody is going to be an Aleks, but we\u2019re quite clear we\u2019ll find another Aleks... If everybody was involved in one way or another, and specifically in this case, football, I think we will have more fans to start with.\u201d\n- Sport Singapore CEO Lim Teck Yin, on the ActiveSG Football Academy to be headed by Aleksandar Duric\nDuric a hit in boots and books\nACE: Aleksandar Duric signing autographs during his book launch at Books Kinokuniya yesterday. TNP PHOTO: EDWIN FONG\nHe may have retired from competitive football more than a year ago, but Aleksandar Duric still looked every bit as poised in front of the camera flashes and swooning fans yesterday.\nThe 45-year-old was at Books Kinokuniya at Ngee Ann City to launch his autobiography Beyond Borders.\nThe 245-page book details his life, from his formative years in the former Yugoslavia, to competing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics as a canoeist, before charting his nomadic career as a footballer, which saw him play for clubs in Australia, China and Singapore, which has become his adopted home.\n\"I feel like a Singaporean,\" Duric said. \"Even though I'm not born here, I'm trying my best to promote Singapore on the sports world map.\"\nBeyond Borders is available at major bookstores at $25 each. - AQIL HAZIQ MAHMUD\nGet The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store now",

    "context": "It\u2019s 11:18pm on Tuesday as I write this from Massachusetts where I was speaking. I got back to the hotel room in time to see about 40 minutes of the Democrat presidential primary debate. I can easily say that former Senator Jim Webb was certainly out of place on that stage. Even Anderson Cooper made the assertion that he was out of touch with the Democrat party. And what did Cooper mean by that? What you saw was a gathering of folks posturing to \u201cout left\u201d each other. I will admit one thing; Anderson Cooper did a professional job in asking tough questions in a direct manner focused on topics and issues \u2014 as opposed to Jake Tapper who only created an animal house environment. But then again, the GOP candidates shouldn\u2019t have followed him down that path.\nThe theme seemed to be all about populism \u2014 tell folks what they want to hear and give them what they want. And it will be paid for by rich people. And the rich people are Republican, and protected by Republicans.\nWhat I found funny was that the Democrat primary selection pool is all old white people \u2014 diversity? If you were watching this debate, you\u2019d believe we\u2019re living in a different America. We\u2019re going to give people free family leave, free healthcare, free education and anything else they want. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s not a right. And it has to be very shocking to our Republic that an avowed socialist is wowing folks. Now, there is one thing on which I do agree with Bernie Sanders, and that is the restoration of Glass-Steagall, since Dodd-Frank has done nothing but punish small community banks.\nBut what was odd to me was the Sanders defense of Hillary Clinton and the \u201cemails\u201d issue. Now, just ask yourself, if this were a Republican, would folks just say move on, nothing to see here? And consider that Hillary Clinton wants to be commander in chief when members of the U.S. Armed Forces would be sentenced to Ft. Leavenworth for such missteps with classified materials.\nAs a matter of fact, consider the case of one U.S. Marine Corps Major Jason Brezler, who may well be discharged from the Corps because he sent \u201cclassified\u201d material over his personal email \u2014 to warn Marines about an Afghan police chief, Sarwar Jan.\nOn that stage last night, there was only one person who could truly be considered to be a commander in chief \u2014 Senator Jim Webb \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t have a chance. I also found it interesting that guns were a target, but there was not much of discussion about mental health or the breakdown of the family and the rise of gangs in the inner cities.\nTo hear Martin O\u2019Malley talk about gun control while knowing what is happening in Baltimore, well, he probably should have skipped that topic. I may have missed it, but did anyone get asked if they own a gun and if they\u2019ve ever bought a firearm at a gun show? Hmm, I have.\nThe real lesson learned from this debate for the GOP is simple \u2014 stop the circular firing squad. Stop allowing debates to descend into the morass of the high school food fight. Let\u2019s see if the GOP candidates learned that lesson.\nThe lesson to be learned for us as a nation is we just saw the far left on full display. Their overarching belief is that President Obama has not gone far enough! And to refer to Republicans as \u201cobstructionists\u201d \u2014 well, consider the first two years of Obama\u2019s presidency with control and massive majorities in the House and Senate \u2014 they did what they wanted. Compromise? Nah, that wasn\u2019t part of the plan.\nIf you want a progressive socialist country, then you had a great night last night. If you seek a Constitutional Republic, you are still yearning.",

Laboratory tests were performed, including establishing inflammatory parameters: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) (range 0\u201310 mg/l), concentrations of gamma globulins (g/dl). ANAs titers and patterns were determined by an indirect immunofluorescence method with HEp2 slides. Anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies were detected by a dot-blot method allowing semi-quantitative evaluation. Serum concentration of APRIL and BAFF were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Minor salivary gland biopsies evaluating the number of inflammatory infiltrates foci [focus score (FS) of mononuclear cells above 50] were performed. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of NIGRR. Differences between groups were analyzed using U Mann-Whitney test (continuous variables). Correlations between variables were assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05\nResults pSS patients had significantly higher serum concentrations of BAFF and ANAs (Mann Whitney test p<0,015, p<0,000 respectively), but not of APRIL, compared to the healthy control (HC) group. There were no differences in serum concentration of BAFF and APRIL between pSS and sicca (S) group. Positive correlation between BAFF and APRIL serum concentrations was found in HC group (r=0,469;p<0,05), but not in pSS and S groups. In S group BAFF positively correlated with CRP (r=0,446;p<0,05) and ANAs positively correlated with a presence of anti-SS-A, anti- SS-B antibodies and a level of gamma globulins. In pSS group there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the concentration of APRIL and: (i) ANAs (r=0,569), (ii) anti-SS-A (r=0,313), (iii) anti -SS-B (r=0,424) and (iv) gamma globulins level (r=0,408). In pSS group ANAs positively correlated with FS (r=0,455).\nConclusions 1. BAFF correlates more closely with an inflammatory reaction, while APRIL with a prolonged autoimmune response, that favoures the production of autoantibodies. 2. Lack of statistically significant differences in the concentrations of BAFF and APRIL between pSS and S group may be explained, based on other studies, by a local BAFF overexpression in salivary glands in pSS group or by an influence of EBV infection or reactivation in both groups (data not shown). 3. Positive correlation between FS and ANAs may suggest a role of ANAs in a local inflammation.\nAcknowledgement Financing of the work \u2013 research grant NCN 2012/05/N/NZ5/028.",

It was a colossal fight between two of the finest greyhounds from Tasmania, Damek\nand I\u2019m A Fencer.\nThe two chasers battled tooth and nail to win the race but in the end it was the flying star, Damek who exhibited extreme enthusiasm and passion in a nail biting finish. The flying star maintained his track record at that circuit and remained unbeaten for\nhis seven trips north to the Devonport Raceway. The chaser scored his victory in the 452 metres trip in a very fast and magnificent time of 25.36 seconds winning by a margin of only a length. He was only 0.23 seconds behind the record time at the track, set\nup by the immensely talented Lilli Pilli Lad back in 2000.\nDamek, the son of Big Daddy Cool and World\u2019s Finest has now conquered 29 out of his 36 total lifetime starts and has total stake earnings in surplus of $71,000.\nAlthough I\u2019m A Fencer has lost the fight but it was really an admirable and heroic effort by the Tasmanian runner. If the chaser, I\u2019m A Fencer had drawn inside Damek the result may have been different. The son of Go Wild Teddy and Wooreddy, I\u2019m A Fencer\nhas rejoiced 14 successes out of his 23 total lifetime starts and has current stake earnings about $24,000. The chaser is looking to be commendable challenger to the flying star Damek in the future.\nGary Sutton, Chairman of the NWGRC (North West Greyhound Racing Club) praised both the chasers at the presentation ceremony. He was also thankful to the associates for racing their two finest chasers in the race to entertain the people.\nPeter Phillip acknowledged his star chaser as \u201ca freak\u201d and announced that the champion will carry on his running in Tasmania in the future.\n\u201cHe does not like travelling, refuses to settle and becomes very anxious away from home. He just does not handle racing interstate, but who cares - he is doing the job here in Tasmania and we just love him,\u201d the trainer stated.\nPeter Phillip was also very excited with the victory of Damek in the Reg and Aileen Ivory Memorial Classic and viewed it as a very significant landmark in his life.\n\u201cIt is a big thrill for me - Reg and Aileen were legends here on the North West Coast, in fact they were legends all over Tasmania,\u201d he further added.\nAlthough Damek has not recorded even a single win in interstate competitions yet his little brother Decembrist presented a major upset by winning in the $25,000 Richmond Derby in a luminous style.\nMeanwhile the son of Bombastic Shiraz and Flick the Switch, the terrific undefeated young chaser, Rybenbrook won at NWGRC meeting for sixth time in a sparkling 25.60 seconds and maintained his winning form as well. Mick Stinger trained chaser made mammoth\nimpression since his debut victory in January, winning by a massive average of eight lengths on every event.",

    "context": ".\nGetting \u201cin to\u201d the novel was a trial in and of itself. I almost didn\u2019t progress past the initial chapter. It was so disjointed and out of context I had no interest in figuring out what was going on. I made no connections to any of the characters and I had no interest in what was going on until Mikael was (FINALLY) hired to investigate the old mystery.\nNow, the good part! The murder mystery part of the novel was fanFREAKINGtastic. I loved the modern look on a murder from 40 years ago\u2013all done through records, photographs and memorabilia from the time. The mystery itself was unique, twisted and intriguing; I found myself pinning the crime on character after character and most of the \u201csuspects\u201d from the crime were still alive and bitter about the investigation. Even the environment of the mystery was tantalizing\u2013it was a locked environment\u2013no way in or out while the murder was committed, so the list of potential suspects was limited by locale. In that respect, \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\u201d is a top notch whodunit with a \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d scenario.\nEnd Good Part.\nYes, that\u2019s pretty much all I liked. The writing was so formal and detached that I couldn\u2019t connect with any of the characters. Even when they were depressed or thrilled or afraid, the writing never let me feel that with them \u2013 it was like watching a dry documentary rather than being immersed in a thriller. I don\u2019t know if that formality was a product of translation or simply how modern business/political thrillers are written. I don\u2019t care which \u2013 it just sucked.\nThe detached writing combined with the characters themselves prohibited any form of connection or identification with either (any) of them. Heavy medication might be the only way to make Lisbeth likable (for me, not her). She is antisocial to the point of disbelief. She is brilliant and certain parts of her character are awesome, but her actions, her choices, and even her speech drive me away from her. I couldn\u2019t identify with more than a couple of her decisions. I\u2019m betting she has a horrific back story that explains exactly why she is the way she is, but I don\u2019t know it, the author didn\u2019t bother to tell me about it, and frankly, I can\u2019t bring myself to care enough about her to continue the trilogy to figure it out.\nThe other main character, Mikael, the reporter, is not as unlikeable as Lisabeth, but he\u2019s certainly no charmer. He carries on the long-standing affair (fling type thing) that ruined his marriage. He maintains that relationship while sleeping with other women \u2013 some the same age as his daughter and comes across as a crappy Casanova. None of the charm or looks, just the luck to fall into the sack with a bunch of chics. And while all of his relationships are consensual, they are treated with a callous casualness that I don\u2019t get. Maybe I\u2019m just an American with my frowning puritan background instead of a more cosmopolitan view of sexual conduct. Maybe, it\u2019s because I grew up with the looming threat of AIDS and the idea of casual sexual partners scares me. Either way, it\u2019s just one more thing between me and liking this guy.\nBeyond Mikael\u2019s sexcapades, there is an onslaught of sexual violence. Wikipedia suggests that Larson initially named his novel \u201cMen who Hate Women.\u201d That is a way more accurate title \u2013 at least it gives a hint about what you\u2019re about to read. Various women in the novel are raped, tortured and murdered \u2013 usually in direct succession. Some of the incidents are described in graphic detail. Others are left to the imagination \u2013 but all are horrific. The book essentially becomes a trifecta of rape, incest and torture.\nThis book should appeal to readers who enjoy gritty realism. But that\u2019s not me. Books like \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u201d are a huge part of the reason why I stick to escapist fantasy and sci-fi.\nIn the end, I stamp this book with a two canary rating for the formal, emotionally-removed writing, the unapproachable characters and the proliferation of rape/sexual assault that was graphic enough to make me consider home-schooling my kids to keep them out of the scary world. I will not be making it to the 2nd novel \u2013 much less the third.\nI\u2019ll stay with my Young Adult, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Romance, and Light Comedy reading agenda. Stepping outside my comfort zone made me lose sleep while checking on my kids.\n___\nWhat do you think, Canaries?\n___\nRead More:\n- Book Review: The Throne of Fire by Rick Riordan\n- Best and Worst: The Beauty and the Beast Within\n- Small Chirps: The Elements of Horror\n- Read more posts by the QuickDrawCanary\nFriends keep telling me that I should read this, so I\u2019m kind of curious to see what I\u2019ll think when I do. Generally I can\u2019t handle violent movies, but for some reason violence in books doesn\u2019t bother me nearly as much. I keep meaning to read this and The Hunger Games, but I keep getting caught up in gloriously escapist sci-fi/fantasy too! \ud83d\ude00\nLike you, I had a really tough time getting into this book and nearly put it down after the first 100 pages or so \u2014 thinking, what\u2019s all the fuss about? But then it really got rocking and rolling and I enjoyed it until the end. I enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd installments too \u2014 and each was different than the others in satisfying ways.\nI\u2019ve wondered if the clunky style is more Larsson\u2019s writing or the translation into English.\nReally? You didn\u2019t like it? I totally agree that the beginning of the book is really hard to get through, but I love the rest of the series. There is a really intricate back story about Lisbeth\u2019s childhood which ties in with the second two books. Maybe I was swayed a little by my love for the Swedish version of the movie, but I came into reading it knowing what to expect and being really psyched about it. I think part of the reason the writing was so detatched was to illustrate how the majority of the family didn\u2019t bother with emotions. It\u2019s not how the main characters felt, but it is a link to some of the characters. Also, I loved the mystery behind Lisbeth. Her badass, take-no-shit mystique really got me hooked. Try reading the second book sometime, it might help you appreciate the first one more. (Although, if you thought this one was too gruesome or dark for you, then I wouldn\u2019t read any more of them. They all go downhill from here. There\u2019s a reason the original title of the Series was \u201cMen Who Hate Women\u201d)",

[For example].\nThis is an incredible interpretation of the B\u00e1b\u2019s ministry that somehow resonates with me as not only true, but also as saying something important about the nature of truth and the vast capacity of the divine for irony and inversion. From the impossible and credulity-straining miracles of old to the quiet miracles of the heart, when we find ourselves as the Hanged Man from Tarot, turned upside down yet seeing rightside up for the first time eyes, to the absurdities of quantum mechanics and the symphony of the celestial spheres, God jokes and God laughs.\nI think often of the B\u00e1b, especially his last moments: how he mysteriously slipped down from the wall of execution upon which had been tied and vanished from before the hail of bullets, not to arise miraculously from the grave, but to finish his conversation with a companion. When he was done, he calmly re-submitted himself to the firing squad. Ever the slippery one, he confronted the arbitrariness of the human world, embodied in the corrupt Persian authorities, and mocked it, transforming his brutal death into a joke that was more than mere human joking, laughing at the darkness, telling it, You are merely the absence of light and a dawn is coming.\nYet, there was also compassion in the joke. Laughter is, after all, a release, and joking is a way of soothing the pains of existence; could it not also be metaphysical, uplifting an individual heart, or indeed, the very soul of the world? The B\u00e1b was saying to us, This life, for all its beauties and horrors, is absurd. Find the truth in the absurd and the absurd in the truth. I want to get the joke. I\u2019m trying very hard, but perhaps in the end, the trick is to do as the B\u00e1b did: I am fastened to this wall with tethers of my own making; let them go and be let go, return to the conversation with the divine, and then submit myself to be struck by bullets cast from the lead of love.\n8 Replies to \u201cA prophetology of laughter\u201d\nPS \u2014 To reiterate, although perhaps it\u2019s needless, I don\u2019t agree with much else that\u2019s in MacEoin\u2019s paper, certainly not MacEoin\u2019s portrayal of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, but I do find his central insight to be remarkable. I should note that what I say here doesn\u2019t contradict or override the essential historical point that MacEoin is making, namely, that the Bab was going to the heart of sharia in order to deconstruct and reconstruct it; rather, I\u2019m expanding upon it spiritually and philosophically.\nThe Bab\u2019s de/reconstruction of sharia reminds of Nader Saeidi\u2019s book \u2018Gate of the Heart\u2019. But this is new to me: to consider the Bab\u2019s ministry as a jest, which makes sense from the perspective that life on earth is limited and we should not take it too seriously. It has a strangely liberating effect.\nHa! Indeed you\u2019re right, especially since I\u2019m one of those very serious types. \ud83d\ude09 And I think there\u2019s many other facets to this \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201cexistential jest\u201d. One would be, ironically, to also enter into and enjoy life in the sense that, as Baha\u2019u\u2019llah said, existence is a gift \u2014 it has its own intrinsic worth to which somehow detachment can also lead us back. And there\u2019s another joke or irony in that, namely, that detachment for the sake of ascending unto God can instead return us to this life. \ud83d\ude09\nWhich explains why the Bab and Baha\u2019ullah, despite obviously aware of the transitory character of this life were at the same time passionately involved in its transformation, giving their lives for that purpose. Examples to follow.\nThanks\nMy picture is really in need of a new title. Your mind is extraordinarily perceptive. I\u2019m so flattered doll!\nHave you read Nader Saiedi\u2019s book, mentioned above? It shows that MacEoin and others had a very big misunderstanding of the Bab\u2019s teachings and laws. And of course, Shoghi Effendi has also clarified the main purpose of the Bab\u2019s legal system in \u201cGod Passes By\u201d.\nHi Nicholas, no, although I\u2019ve heard about it from several sources long before this post. But let\u2019s suppose Saiedi is correct and that MacEoin is profoundly wrong about the Babi dispensation: does that negate the essence of my reflection?\nI\u2019m afraid I only have a \u2018big misunderstanding\u2019 of the Bab\u2019s teachings and laws from a Baha\u2019i perspective. But I am not a Baha\u2019i, so I\u2019m free to come up with whatever views I like, and you may find that many or most secular non-Baha\u2019is will, in some measure, agree with me.",

A lot has happened since the \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign was launched in 2014. By investing in the country\u2019s infrastructure and lowering corporate tax rates, the Indian government has succeeded in attracting a growing number of international investors. Today, India stands not just for services and IT, but also for a commitment to modernizing the nation\u2019s industry, with the goal of ramping up domestic production. Visitors to CeMAT India (1 to 3 December 2016 in Mumbai) can get an initial impression of the competence of Indian industry, with well-known enterprises like Carlstahl Craftsman Enterprises, Kompress India, Nash Robotics & Automation, Rajdlari Storage Systems, Godrej & Boyce, Cascade and Jungheinrich as exhibitors there. Embedded in the WIN India trade fair, these exhibitors will be demonstrating the key role played by intralogistics in automated systems. Manufacturing industries currently constitute only 15 percent of India\u2019s gross domestic product, with a concomitant huge potential for further development. According to the latest information supplied by GTAI (Germany Trade & Invest), private consumption in India is growing fast, resulting in above-average demand for the types of machines needed by consumer-related industries like textiles, chemicals, automotive and packaging. Not surprisingly, online retailing has also been growing in India the last few years. Whereas in 2013, Indian consumers bought some 10.7 billion US dollars\u2019 worth of goods, one year later the figure had gone up by 34 percent, for a total of 16.4 billion, according to pwc. In 2015 sales had climbed to 22 billion dollars, with the curve continuing to point upward. This growth also means higher demands on the supply chain \u2013 which brings us to the intralogistics providers showcasing their comprehensive solutions at CeMAT India. The organizers of WIN India are expecting a total of some 200 exhibitors and more than 10,000 visitors at the upcoming event, where there will also be a wide-ranging program of forums on the latest challenges and developments involving the supply chain. The first day of the show will feature a discussion on the topic of \u201cThe Supply Chain in a Digital World\u201d. On the second day, presentations and discussions will include techniques and strategies for minimizing supply chain risks, as well as the role that state-of-the-art technologies can play in the modernization process. I wish all of you a successful trade fair, with numerous successful leads, inspiring talks and outstanding business.

The mobile data recording terminal combines the user-friendly design, low costs and flexibility of a smartphone with a robust, portable unit with an integrated barcode scanner. Stat Control now internationally certified Statistical inventory counts offer significant advantages compared with full inventory counts. They reduce the counting effort and therefore the costs and warehouse closing times, as well as error rates. Stat Control GmbH, a company specialising in inventory software, now has separate certifications for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for the first time. Alongside inventory management, companies are increasingly focusing on monitoring stock during the year. In contrast to value-based inventory counts, stock controls are risk oriented and designed to secure processes, which is where the systems currently offered by Stat Control provide manifold support. The Software Starwarp, for instance, can carry out a riskbased ABC analysis, which uses various factors to categorise stock items into risk clusters.

The changes will not, however, include the restoration of news feeds from Live!, Felix and stoic tv. The three media outlets had all been a permanent fixture on the old site and Live! was given assurances in June last year that they would return. Despite plans to do so being well advanced they have now been dropped from the final redesign, apparently at the behest of ICU President John Collins. Mr Collins denied all knowledge, claiming - with a wry smile on his face - that small details like that did not concern him. Earlier in the year he said of the plan: \"what if there's bad news?\"\nThe news section of the redesigned website will continue carrying propaganda amongst event advertising and election results. Burying bad news is not uncommon this year and was especially apparent when Mr Collins came off his bike - the page advertising his progress was swiftly dumped from the front page, where it was intended to stay for the duration of his ride. Those visiting it through the feed on the Live! front page noted that it did not mention an accident until several days later, initially claiming the ride had been stopped due to bad weather.\nLive! Editor Ashley Brown commented on the U-turn: \"We must be doing a good job if they are trying to limit our audience - what does the Union have to hide? I'm sure Stephen Brown is made of sterner stuff: I've seen him in a kilt and he didn't mind having his dirty laundry on display then.\"\nUnconfirmed rumours are circulating that this latest spat between Beit Towers and Live! is down to the ICU President being sore at having no picture of himself with the Queen in Reporter, Imperial's staff magazine. His only presence is in the background of another photo, apparently wiping his nose. A certain media editor received much more coverage.\nAnyone looking for a balanced view of events in the Union should, of course, add Live! as their home page. As well as the latest news and critical analysis, the front page includes news feeds from College, ICU and the BBC, alongside the latest weather forecast and tube status.

Once he realizes Amin's insanity and viciousness, he's appalled that he's abetting the tyrant.\nCast Gillian Anderson, Forest Whitaker, James McAvoy, David Oyelowo, Kerry Washington, Simon McBurney (more)\nDirector(s) Kevin MacDonald\nWriter(s) Peter Morgan, Jeremy Brock\nStatus In theaters (limited)\nGenre(s) Drama\nRelease Date Sept. 27, 2006\nMPAA Rating R - for some strong violence and gruesome images, sexual content and language.\nReview:\nThe Last King of Scotland is an interesting character study and shows that sometimes the scariest villains are the one that seem harmless. Here is where Forest Whitaker, perennial movie nice guy, fits in perfectly. Whitaker always brings a sense of sereneness to his roles. In this film Whitaker adds a sense of unpredictability and danger to his usual machinations. Whitaker conveys such an excellent sense of charm and madness that you never really know what his character will do. Needless to say Whitaker is well deserving of his Oscar nod but sadly he's the best facet of this heavy handed movie. Kevin MacDonald directs this film sloppily and has a tendency to beat the audience over the head with important or dramatic moments. It's far from a horrible effort but with the top tier performances from Whitaker and McAvoy, to a lesser extent, a more subdued directorial hand may have served the film better. This film is worth watching simply to see Whitaker dish out a career defining performance.\nC+\nOn DVD\nMARIE ANTOINETTE\nWhen betrothed to King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), the Austrian-born Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) enters the French court, rebels against Versailles and becomes France's most misunderstood monarch. Stripped of her riches, imprisoned and beheaded by her own subjects, the queen of France becomes a symbol of excess.\nCast Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, Marianne Faithfull (more)\nDirector(s) Sofia Coppola\nWriter(s) Sofia Coppola\nStatus On DVD\nGenre(s) Drama\nRelease Date Oct. 20, 2006\nDVD Release Date Feb. 13, 2007\nMPAA Rating PG-13 - for sexual content, partial nudity and innuendo.\nReview:\nSofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette is an opulent exercise in stagnation. If you are looking for a sweeping historical epic then you will be sorely disappointed with this film. Instead, Coppola chooses to focus on the title character's sense of confinement. This is a film that has an almost dream like lack of forward momentum. Coppola does inject the film with some style by infusing some modern music into certain of the films sequences. Once Marie arrives a Versailles Coppola plays it more as if she's been sentenced to a gaudy prison sentence. Kirsten Dunst is decent as the titular character giving her a decent amount of naivet\u00e9 and confusion. Jason Schwartzman is given painfully little to do here other than look perplexed and uninterested. Still, while this movie might not be for everyone, Sophia Coppola does deliver an interesting film, so much so that when the movie reaches its historical climax you feel a true sense of pain and empathy for the title character.\nB+",

Even those of us with busy lifestyles can find the time to listen to a podcast or two, as listening to audio is a great way to pass the time while commuting, exercising, relaxing, washing dishes, and doing other activities that don\u2019t require your undivided attention. (It's best not to have earbuds in while walking, running, biking, or driving on the road, though!) And, unlike when you\u2019re browsing the web, when you\u2019re listening to podcasts you don\u2019t have to worry about getting distracted by annoying comments or accidentally seeing graphic photos of animals on factory farms.\nI\u2019ve been listening to several animal rights/vegan podcasts lately. Here are my top 3 favourites:\n1) Food for Thought Podcast with Colleen Patrick-Goudreau.\nI could write a whole article about Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, but in short, Colleen is a vegan advocate who promotes joyful vegan living and compassionate communication. Her podcast, Food for Thought, focuses on a different topic to do with animal rights and/or veganism in each episode. Examples of podcast episode titles include \u201cTraveling to Africa: Planning and Preparing for a Dream Trip\u201d (this was an exciting one), \u201cAdvocacy and Adaptation: Fitting In and Living Joyfully in a Non-Vegan World\u201d, and \u201cAnimal Word Origins\u201d.\nAlthough of course I don\u2019t agree with everything Colleen says, I do love her message of unapologetic and compassionate vegan living. I\u2019ve listened to about 25 of her podcast episodes so far. They are inspiring and informative!\nIn addition to creating her own podcast, Colleen also makes videos, writes books and articles, gives speeches, and more! Her podcast and other materials can be found on her website at\nI'd recommend Food for Thought if you are looking for: information, advice, and inspiration to help you lead a joyful, compassionate, and unapologetic vegan activist lifestyle.\nI'd recommend Food for Thought if you are looking for: information, advice, and inspiration to help you lead a joyful, compassionate, and unapologetic vegan activist lifestyle.\n2) The Vegan Option with Ian McDonald.\nThe Vegan Option is a documentary-style podcast hosted by Ian McDonald. The episodes are so fascinating\u2014and sound so professional\u2014that they are definitely worth a listen! Examples of episodes include the \u201cVegetarianism: The Story So Far\u201d series (about the history of vegetarianism\u2014it\u2019s very interesting), \u201cScience Fiction and Animals\u201d (which includes a funny Doctor Who parody audio sketch), and the \u201cVeganism in Politics\u201d series (which I look forward to listening to soon). Find his podcast at.\nI'd recommend The Vegan Option if you are looking for: compelling documentary stories and ideas about animals and veganism in society.\nI'd recommend The Vegan Option if you are looking for: compelling documentary stories and ideas about animals and veganism in society.\n3) Our Hen House Podcast with Jasmin Singer and Mariann Sullivan.\nOur Hen House Podcast is a weekly podcast hosted by Jasmin Singer and Mariann Sullivan. The main section of each podcast includes interviews with various animal rights/vegan activists; there\u2019s also an animal rights news segment and a \u201cRising Anxieties\u201d segment about how the animal industries are taking notice of the animal rights movement. Each episode also includes some commentary and chit-chat. It reminds me of listening to the radio because it has lots of different sections to it. I don\u2019t agree with all of their positions on certain subjects, but I usually really like listening to this podcast. And it provides plenty of inspiration to activists who are looking to do more to help animals. You can find the podcast at. They also have an \"Animal Law\" podcast and a \"Teaching Jasmin How to Cook Vegan\" podcast.\nI'd recommend Our Hen House if you are looking: to keep updated on the latest goings-on in the animal rights world, and to be inspired to help animals by hearing about what other activists are doing.\nI'd recommend Our Hen House if you are looking: to keep updated on the latest goings-on in the animal rights world, and to be inspired to help animals by hearing about what other activists are doing.\nJust to let you know, I will be posting this post on my new blog, as well.

I left the USA at the age of 23 to live in England. After 18 years in England we moved to Switzerland with an 8 year old and 2.5 year old twins. We chose to enrol our children in the local school system. This has been a wonderful, difficult, enlightening, frustrating process to say the least! On the plus side, I have three trilingual children (English, Swiss German, High German). They have all been allowed to have an old fashioned childhood here (walking to and from school, playing freely, no formal education until the third year of school 6-7 years old). For all the blessings of choosing local schooling, it has also been a very difficult process at times. I am currently looking into home schooling as a supplement for my children's education. We are looking to return to the USA as a family in the next two years and as the schooling schedule is very different here, my children will not be able to conform to a \"local\" system. I also feel that although the children have benefited greatly by being in the local system, they do struggle and are behind as we do not speak German at home 24x7 which is the language that they learn in. This has led to all of the children being tested for learning difficulties. This is a normal occurence for foreign children. For as good as the system is, it still struggles with the integration of german as a second language families. I have joined this forum as I am at a loss as to how to begin the homeschooling process. Completely overwhelmed where to begin to look for curriculum and how to proceed as my children will still attend Swiss school while I attempt to supplement their education at home. (Children here only go to school 5 mornings a week and 2 afternoons until the age of 9. All children come home for lunch each day and all children have Wednesday afternoons off, so I have a lot of time with the boys). Preferably, I would like a complete homeschooling system to follow that walks me through each phase and each year with the minimal planning on my part. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as would any sites that you might recommend. Sincerely, Rhonda",

That is the reason; the real estate industry is constantly flourishing and will never be out of business.\nBuilders and small scale real estate businessmen, therefore, are continuously coming up with new projects and ideas for the potential buyers. These construction choices are many in number. The most common construction projects include \u2013\n- Residential apartments\n- Bungalows and condos\n- Commercial buildings\n- Malls and shops.\nAmongst these, the most popular constructions are the residential apartments. Everyone desires to have a personal property, but few can own a big house. However, apartments are way more affordable. That is the reason, why there is always a demand for residential apartments.\nBuilders construct residential apartments more:\nDue to this increased demand of the residential apartments, the builders make these residential apartments more than any other type of construction. Besides, home loans are easily approved for the residential apartments. Hence, the buyers are keener to buy these over the other types of real estate options.\nProfit associated with constructing residential apartments:\nIf you too are thinking of trying your luck in the real estate business and want to construct a residential building, this is an ideal time for that. However, before you do so, you must understand the factors that you should be taking care of.\nConstruction business is a very profitable one, provided you know how to proceed in it. If you take the right steps, you will be able to gain huge profits in a single go. If you take the wrong steps, you might not be able to sell your apartments easily to potential buyers.\n- Hire the best construction equipment:\nConstruction equipment is one of the most important factors that you need to consider before starting your business. Without the construction equipment, you will not be able to complete the project fast and this will hinder your profit. To make sure that the profit is high, it is always a good idea to own the construction equipment. You can choose the second hand equipment for reducing the cost. There are many construction equipment dealers that deal in new or old construction equipment. If you have a limited budget, you can always start by hiring the equipment. The more you save on the construction equipment, the higher will be your profit margin for the residential apartments.\n- Promotion:\nOnce you have started your residential apartment building project, proper promotion or advertisement is a must. The more you advertise, the higher are your chances of getting potential buyers easily and fast. Always make sure that you make use of the free online advertisement platforms and forums for this purpose. This will reduce the price of advertisement and increase your profit.\nAlong with these two important and basic factors, it is also important that you start the project in a well-developed or developing place, so that it is easier for you to sell the residential apartments for a profitable price.",

    "context": "Why does butter temperature matter?\nButter acts like the \u2018glue\u2019 that holds together the other ingredients. Because of its structure, butter holds the key to the texture, aeration, and shape of cookies. Many cookies call for \u2018creaming\u2019 the butter and sugar together before adding dry ingredients. This ensures the butter will be distributed evenly throughout the cookie. For best results, creaming should be done for 2-3 minutes in most cases. Room temperature butter is best for this procedure. Avoid creaming butter and sugars together at a speed higher than medium. Too much friction will cause the butter to heat up and break down. For flaky cookies and many shortbreads you will need very cold butter. The cold butter globs settle between layers of flour and, when baked, melt leaving pockets of air which create layers and texture. For best results, cut butter into small cubes and place them in the freezer before starting dough. Consult the recipe and follow it closely.\nShould you use paper or foil lining?\nLining baking sheets is one of the easiest ways to ensure the right type of baking and also makes for simple clean up. Parchment paper is the standard choice for most cookie baking, but it is not always the right choice. For thin cookies with a crispy bottom choose foil. Use the less-shiny side up in the bottom of your baking tray. The foil will radiate heat back up toward the cookie and non-porous nature of the foil will keep the fats near the bottom of the cookie creating a crispier bottom. In either case, allow the cookies to cool so you can peel them away from the liner if necessary. Tip: look for flat pre-cut parchment sheets at restaurant supply stores. They fit perfectly in pans and do not roll up on the ends.\nWhy does it matter how I cool my cookies?\nIt comes down to how long the cookies should continue to cook. For many standard cookies, which are somewhat soft on the inside and a bit crisp on the outside, cooling for just a minute or two on the tray before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely is the right answer. However other cookies, including many shortbreads, require cooling completely on the tray for best results. The additional contact with heat allows the cookie to cook more completely on the inside and creates a more sturdy bottom. As ever, consult the recipe and follow it closely.\nHow do I bake a baker\u2019s dozen?\nWhile baking cookies is a fun pastime, nobody wants to spend unnecessary time watching the oven. Using a baker\u2019s dozen layout for your cookies will allow you to get more cookies done in less time. Plus, that leaves one extra cookie for the cook. Use the layout in the photo above. Start by placing the first ball of dough in the very center of the pan. Make a diagonal line from there across the cookie sheet with four more dough balls evenly spaced. Use those balls as the guide for the remaining rows of cookies.\nDo I really need a cookie scoop?\nThe short answer is no. You don\u2019t really need a cookie scoop unless you are making cookies that will be sandwiched together. However, if you want cookies to be of consistent size and shape it is the best way to ensure good results. Further, using a cookie scoop is often less messy than scraping from a spoon. Cookie scoops come in a wide variety of sizes. Pick up a few for differently sized cookies.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to measure flour?\nMeasuring flour properly is one of the most critical steps in consistent cookies from time to time. Also, improper measuring can result in a cookie that is too dry or tough. For best results use a scoop to gently shake the flour into your measuring cup. Then use a knife or offset spatula to scrape the flour level with the top of the cup. Tip: Although not commonly used in the U.S., the best method for measuring in baking is with a kitchen scale. For consistent results, measure ingredients from your recipe in grams. Make note of the measurements on the recipe for future reference.\nCan I make cookies without a mixer?\nYou can and you should in many cases. The single most common cause for tough cookies is over mixing. The mixer is great for creaming together butter and sugars, but beyond that most cookies require very little beating. Dry ingredients and extras such as chocolate chips, nuts and dried fruit generally only need to be mixed just until the ingredients are incorporated. Of course, there are some exceptions.\nWhy do recipes call for refrigerating dough? Do I really need to do it?\nThe typical reason for this is two-fold. First, in some cases the flour needs time to work its magic. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, refrigeration is often recommended to allow the butter to come back to a hardened state. Even if the recipe doesn\u2019t call for chilling, consider chilling and bringing the dough back to room temperature before baking. Cookie dough that has been allowed to rest and chill overnight often has better flavor and texture.\nHow can I bake more cookies in less time?\nIt\u2019s all in the rotation. If you are going to make many cookies consider purchasing at least four baking sheets. Tip: Standard professional, rolled-rim baking sheets are readily available at restaurant supply stores and often far less expensive than gimmicky ones sold in retail stores. For maximum baking production arrange your oven racks in the center of the oven. Place a tray on each rack and set a timer for about a quarter of the overall expected baking time. To estimate the time add 4-6 minutes to the baking time in the recipe as if you were only going to bake one sheet at a time. At the end of the first time, take the bottom tray out and place it on the stove, turning the front of the tray to the back. Remove the middle tray and put it on the bottom, also turning it around. Move the top tray to the middle and turn it. Place the tray on the stove top on the top rack. Continue setting the timer and rotating the trays in the same manner until they are done.",

Be the first to answer!\nNYX Liquid Crystal Body Liner\nReviews (485)\nQ&A (21)\nMedia (85)\nREVIEWS\nI love these glitter liners I need all of them! They\u2019re such an easy way to amp up your look without having to work so hard. A little on the inner corner or lid makes a difference in your look! I was afraid of it stinging a little because some glitter liner does that but this one didn\u2019t for me. It isn\u2019t a blob of glitter mind you it\u2019s more of a sparkle but you can definitely build it up. It doesn\u2019t crumble either which is important!\nThese are sooo pretty and pigmented I used this for a cut crease and it stayed incredibly well! Didn\u2019t crack or crumble like a lot of other glitters I have tried it stayed in place. Also love the brush on these it\u2019s super fine so you can be precise I\u2019m all about a glitter that isn\u2019t a hassle to use! My only issue is when I first applied this it felt like my eyelid was burning for a second not sure why?\nThis was super inexpensive compared to the UD Heavy Metal Liners and it worked just as great! I have had this product for three days so far and I have already done two lip looks with it! It kind of stung when I first put it on my lips for the polka dot look but the stinging went away. NYX Liquid Crystal Body LinerCiat\u00e9 London Liquid Velvet\u2122 Moisturizing Matte Liquid LipstickNYX Liquid Suede Cream LipstickCiat\u00e9 London Liquid Velvet\u2122 Moisturizing Matte Liquid Lipstick\nHoly burn!! This product burned my eye lids so bad! After applying and letting it dry it was still burning and it peeled off. I thought I could be budget friendly and opt for this over Urban Decay but I do not recommend!! It isn't worth the searing pain! Super thankful it didn't leave a red burn line on my eye! Will not apply this again.\nThese are awesome!! I use them to line my cut creases when I'm in the mood for a more glammed out, dramatic look. But you can use these for pretty much anything you can think to do with a glitter liner. They dry fairly quickly, which is great. And they are FULL of glitter so you usually only need one pass.\nI've gotten this product twice because it's that good and the quantity isn't very much. I don't mind as i don't use glitter often. Maybe a few times a year. The first time i bought it 2 years ago and everything about it was Awesome. It didn't smudge, it didn't flake off my oily lids, it stayed all night (except for the parts i applied tooooomuch - my error) but the second time i bought it, i don't know if they changed the formula or what but now it makes my eye lids burn.\nI love this liner. I like to apply it around my black winged liner. It gives such a nice effect and it really enhances your wing. I have blue eyes and really makes them stand out. This is a really good dupe for the Urban Decay Heavy Metal Glitter Liners, which are really good. This is only about $5 so it\u2019s such a great dupe. NYX has some really great products and this is one of them!!\nI love this silver eyeliner so much! I have seen a lot of people use on top on their black wing eyeliner! Is so cute! I love the looks! Is cheap and affordable! I had gotten this at ulta and had a coupon for 20% off! I got it for $3! Now that's cheap! I recommend this product!\nReview for: Crystal jade, Crystal Aqua, Crystal silk, Crystal Gun Metal, Crystal Gold, Crystal Pewter, Crystal Hip, Crystal pink, Crystal Silver more...\nDon't sleep on these! Very inexpensive for good quality & long lasting glitter. Comparable to the Urban Decay Heavy Metals. I can't give it 5 stars only because I wish there was a bigger color selection cause it's such a nice, quick liner. Urban Decay Heavy Metal Glitter Eyeliner\nI love this liner because it\u2019s metallic! It\u2019s perfect for that pop of color. I love using this during Halloween because it\u2019s easy to use and apply. What is perfect about it, is it can be used anywhere; face and body. I used it to add a metallic pop when I did a skull inspired look for last years Halloween.\nQ & A\nDoes anyone find that these liners cause irritation and a burning sensation when used on the eyes??

    "context": "Miss Universe in Chin State - showing off the fabrics. Photo: Moe Sat Wine/Facebook\nTwenty-eight-year-old Cing Zeel Niang was born in Chin State but left home at an early age to attend boarding school in Pyin Oo Lwin and later studied medicine in Mandalay. Her parents felt that it was in their daughter\u2019s best interests to be educated outside her home state, as standards are lower than in other parts of the country. Chin State lacks a single university - the closest is in neighbouring Sagaing Region \u2013 and it is the most underdeveloped nationwide in terms of infrastructure. Cing Zeel Niang - Rosy - graduated in 2012 and began working at a private hospital, but had long had plans to start a business in a completely different walk of life and one that was closer to her roots \u2013 selling Chin textiles online via Facebook.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen anyone try do it,\u201d she told Mizzima Weekly.\nRosy explained that selling via Facebook is more practical than setting up a dedicated website, as slow internet speeds would make page loading difficult and frustrate potential customers.\nHowever, Rosy was daunted by her lack of first-hand experience in running a business.\n\u201cNo one in my family has any business experience and they weren\u2019t at all familiar with online businesses. So I didn\u2019t have any business knowledge passed down to me.\u201d\nIn 2014, Rosy leapt at the chance to take part in a start-up business course with the social enterprise Project Hub Yangon (PHY). The six-month course was the first to exclusively target female entrepreneurs in Myanmar.\n\u201cThe incubation programme gave me the skills to refine my business idea. If I didn\u2019t take part in it, I don\u2019t think I would have started my business,\u201d she said.\nLike many people in Myanmar, where bank loans are virtually unobtainable without collateral, Rosy lacked funding to back her bright idea. Fortunately, the knowledge she acquired through PHY\u2019s programme helped her to develop creative solutions to counter financial constraints, which is an integral part of start-up business methodology.\nWhile still working at the hospital, Rosy began selling Chin fabrics for a handful of Chin women. She photographed the fabrics and uploaded them to her Facebook page, Rosy\u2019s Chin Fabrics, so that she received orders instead of speculatively purchasing anything.\n\u201cI also used my colleagues at the hospital, 99 percent of whom were female, to do market research. They were all interested in Chin fabrics and I got to know the price range they were willing to spend.\u201d\nShe also quickly discovered that Myanmar women are eager to wear fabrics belongings to a different ethnicity.\n\u201cBamar women have no problem wearing different fabrics. If the price is right, they actually prefer to wear tribal fabrics because it makes them stand out,\u201d she explained.\nOnce she had a sizeable number of orders, Rosy began travelling to Chin State to source the fabrics.\nHowever Rosy\u2019s parents were dismayed to learn that their daughter planned to launch an online business rather than continuing her work as a medical officer.\n\u201cMy mother wanted me to have a stable, respected profession. It took me six months to convince her that I wouldn\u2019t give up my medical career entirely and that I could balance it with my online business,\u201d she said.\nBy day, Rosy runs her online business and at night she works as a medical consultant for a parenting website.\nRosy has been running her business for 18 months now and has her family\u2019s full support. When she gave birth seven months ago, her mother volunteered to travel to Chin State to buy the fabrics.\n\u201cMy mother works with my second cousin, who belongs to a group of weavers.\u201d\nHowever, although Rosy and her mother know a great deal about the traditions behind Chin weaving, which is considered the most intricate of any ethnicity in Myanmar and requires at least two weeks to complete a single piece, neither know how to weave.\n\u201cMy mother cannot weave and I also cannot, so it\u2019s unlikely that my daughter will learn either,\u201d said the 28-year-old.\n\u201cThe number of Chin people who know how to weave is decreasing. Women my age don\u2019t know how to weave \u2013 those who do are my grandmother\u2019s age, which makes it almost impossible to pass on the information.\u201d\nIf the tradition of hand-weaving were to die out altogether, it would be a huge loss to a fascinating tradition. Whilst Chin fabrics have more than an ornamental role, with shawls keeping its bearers warm in one of the coolest areas of tropical Myanmar, many are rich in cultural significance. Shawls are highly specific to each of the dozen sub-groups of the Chin people and are also used to mark significant occasions, such as marriage and death. Special blankets, historically woven by the bride, are presented to a couple to mark their marriage \u2013 and cover the corpse upon death.\nA red shawl, which incidentally looks very much like Scottish tartan, is given to a male who in earlier times fought and killed an enemy from another village, or killed an animal that threatened the safety of his fellow villagers. The shawl is worn during the celebrations that follow, and other men who previously received the honour also don red shawls.\nWomen of certain Chin tribes receive a white, green and red shawl when they get married, and wear black and white shawls during periods of mourning. Orange is a popular colour for shawls worn by Chin people (who are also sometimes referred to as Zomi) in India, which borders Chin State. Rosy\u2019s primary market is domestic but she also ships items to the United States, where a sizeable population of Chin people live.\nRosy said that new fabric patterns are created every few months, but added that Chin weaving is becoming increasingly rare due to the lack of livelihood opportunities it offers in modern times.\n\u201cMy dream and vision is to inspire young women living in villages in Chin State to know that they can still make a living out of weaving,\u201d she said.\nWhile machine-made alternatives exist, Rosy steers well clear of them: every item on offer is produced by a handloom.\n\u201cThis is a socially responsible business \u2013 products made using a machine simply won\u2019t work for me. When everything is done by a machine, there\u2019s no value in it. And machines cannot do the most complex work.\u201d\nRosy is also keen to motivate other women to start their own businesses and follow their passions.\n\u201cI have always wanted to inspire other women to start something new and to follow their dreams. Even if there is a lot of pressure and a lack of support, just keep at it and eventually you will succeed \u2013 you will get somewhere if you put enough effort in. When I started my business I didn\u2019t get enough sleep: I had to learn online skills and it took a lot of time. But finally it\u2019s paid off,\u201d she said.\n(Featured in Mizzima Weekly Issue 20 \u2013 To )",

The renewed and expanded pact will run through the 2022-23 season. Under the prior deal, Verizon has paid around $250 million per year ($1 billion total over the four-year span).\nThe new Verizon-NFL deal covers all in-market and national games, including preseason, regular season, and playoff games \u2014 including the Super Bowl \u2014 available to anyone in the U.S., on any mobile carrier or network provider. The package includes live-streaming rights to the NFL\u2019s Thursday, Sunday and Monday Night Football games, and the Sunday day games that air on TV in viewers\u2019 local market.\nVerizon\u2019s rights extend to mobile phones across all carriers and across Oath properties, including Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, AOL, and Go90. According to the company, its mobile and digital properties reach more than 200 million monthly unique users in the U.S. The new NFL deal also grants Verizon rights to sell select in-game ad inventory on its platforms.\nEssentially, Verizon is getting U.S. multiplatform live-streaming rights to the entire NFL schedule \u2014 with the exception of Sunday afternoon out-of-market games. Those remain with AT&T\u2019s DirecTV, which has locked up the NFL Sunday Ticket package through the end of the 2022-23 season.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a commitment to fans for Verizon\u2019s family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,\u201d Lowell McAdam, chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications, said in a statement. \u201cThe NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it.\u201d\nTV broadcast rights, however, are still where the NFL makes its mint. The league rakes in an estimated $7 billion per year from TV deals, including with CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN, representing about half its overall revenue.\nThe full extent of the new Verizon-NFL deal won\u2019t go into effect until the 2018-19 season, but certain elements will roll out this postseason. Specifically, NFL postseason games will be available on Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, and Go90 (along with the NFL Mobile app) beginning no later than the conference championships on Jan. 21.\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell, in a statement, praised Verizon as a partner and emphasized that the deal will extend the league\u2019s games to any mobile device \u201cregardless of carrier.\u201d Verizon has carried NFL games on mobile since 2010.\nIn addition to the expanded availability of live games, the new NFL-Verizon agreement encompasses mobile access to NFL highlights, coverage of NFL throughout the week and year, and a set of jointly developed original content (like virtual-reality experiences). Verizon has global distribution rights to the on-demand content, while the live games are U.S.-only.\nUnder the pact, Verizon also will continue to be the official wireless sponsor of the NFL while the telco\u2019s media brands like Yahoo will become official NFL sponsor brands as well. Also, starting with the 2018 NFL season, Verizon will become the presenting sponsor of the Pro Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine.\nVerizon formed the Oath digital-media group this summer, combining AOL and Yahoo under one umbrella, after closing the $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo in June 2017.\nThe NFL has divvied up the rights to its crown jewels \u2014 the live games \u2014 across TV and digital partners for the last several years. This past season, it granted Amazon worldwide streaming rights to the 11-game \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d lineup for a reported $50 million (after Twitter had \u201cTNF\u201d in 2016). And Verizon paid the league around $20 million to live-stream a single regular-season game (the Sept. 24 Ravens-Jaguars meeting in London), paying a premium because it wasn\u2019t broadcast nationally in the U.S.\nVerizon\u2019s $2 billion NFL rights deal comes as tech players including Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter are looking to spend big bucks to bring more sports to their digital services. Facebook is said to be particularly aggressive: The social giant is seeking to hire an exec who will have a budget of a \u201cfew billion dollars\u201d for sports-rights deals, Sports Business Journal reported last month.",

Some of the others served on other swift boats while Kerry was in Viet Nam. The leader of the group, John O'Neill, who also wrote the book that the group has published, arrived in Viet Nam two months after Kerry left Viet Nam. John O'Neill has no first-hand knowledge of Kerry's service in Viet Nam.\nBut that hasn't stopped O'Neill from dogging Kerry for 30 years, trying to discredit him. This guy appeared on a TV debate with Kerry during, and with the approval of, the Nixon administration. He has been after Kerry ever since. He claims to be non-partisan, but it seems obvious to me that he is a Republican operative, and that his group is being funded with Republican money.\nOriginally posted by GradyPhilpott.\nDon,\nYour story sounds plausible, in so far as the timelines and the events match up pretty well. It is, however, difficult for me to understand that you would be so vague about things like unit designations and MOS.\nAlso, your referral to Recruit Training (or more, commonly, Boot Camp) as basic training, infantry training, rather than ITR, guerilla warfare training at Camp Pendleton, rather than Staging Bn.,\nIt is true that 35 years is a long time. But, there are things that stay with Marines, not the least of which is the language. This is especially true when speaking to another Marine.\nOne thing that I wonder about is your schooling. You said you completed RTR and ITR and then awaited OCS, opting out finally to serve out your enlistment. Were you trained as data processor?\nIf you served,\nI am grateful for that, but I have to wonder how you can reconcile Kerry's behavior upon returning to the US. John Kerry turned coat and sided with the communists.\nHe lied about the actions of the military in Vietnam.\nBut, that is not what counts. Kerry betrayed his country and took sides with the enemy.\nThat's all any loyal American needs to know. Anyone who supports him is siding with the enemy, because John Kerry is the enemy.\nOriginally posted by curme]\nI was in Iraq, with the Army, during the initial invasion of Iraq (G.W., not his Dad). I speak out against the occupation every chance I get. Am I betraying my country? I'm I not a loyal American? I think people like Kerry, or myself, have a unique perspective about the conflicts we were in, and have an obligation, as loyal Americans, to tell fellow Americans, what an atrocity we were in involved in.\nThe last poll I saw, Bush led Kerry in support among veterans by 56-40. That means 40% of veterans think Kerry will be a better President than George Bush.\nVeterans prefer Bush as Commander-in-Chief by a 60% to 33% margin. Fifty-four percent (54%) of veterans give the President good or excellent ratings for handling the situation in Iraq. Overall, just 43% of voters give the President such positive ratings on Iraq.\nOriginally posted by GradyPhilpott\nI stand by my statement. The tide has turned. America's enemies are in our midst and they are hell-bent-for-leather to destroy us and our way of life. If these conditions are not enough to cause you to put aside your petty wrangling and stand up proudly as a loyal American, willing to risk all for our preservation, then you are the enemy.\nTo paraphrase GW Bush, you are either with us or you are against us.\nOriginally posted by slank\nAll this does is highlight the fact that GW Bush is a Chicken pussy who couldn't even be bothered to show up for bogus duty in Alabama. He was AWOL and a DESERTER.\n\"The documents released on Friday by the Pentagon included two faded computerized payroll sheets showing Bush was not paid during the latter part of 1972 and offer no evidence to place Bush in Alabama during the latter part of 1972.\"...\nHe wasn't paid because he wasnt there. period.\n.\nOriginally posted by donguillermo\nMy MOS was 4011, DataProcEquipOper. As I explained, I actually held the job title of computer programmer. My last duty assignment and major command was H&HSCo, SupBn, 1st FSR//FLC.\nMy decorations, medals, and badges included Rifle Expert Badge, National Defense Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal. The Navy Achievement Medal with Combat \"V\", which I previously mentioned, was awarded after my release from active duty. The Marine Corps invited me to attend an awards ceremony at MCAS, Yuma, Arizona, but I declined.\nIs that good enough?\nI guess it is true that there are those who were in the Marine Corps, but never became Marines.\nOriginally posted by GradyPhilpott\nOriginally posted by RANT\nWow. You missed alot over there. Let me catch you up as to what really happened to your country while you were away, and submit it wasn't all John Kerry.\nRant\nI'm fully aware of the events you mention. Your language tells me that you are a marxist who despises the principles this nation was founded on. You are the enemy. You are what is wrong with America, if in fact, you actually reside here. If you do live here, you might actually feel more comfortable in Canada or France.\nOriginally posted by donguillermo\nGradyPhilpott says,\nI guess it is true that there are those who were in the Marine Corps, but never became Marines.\nI have really had enough of your chest-thumping, flag-waving, patriotic pride in having been one of Uncle Sam's Misguided Children.\nOriginally posted by GradyPhilpott\nWhat do you take pride in, Don?\n\"Once a Marine, always a Marine.\"\nWhatever happened to the idea of Viet Nam veterans hanging together and supporting each other?",

    "context": "Whenever, and wherever you see a novel or a film containing teleportation; it is safe to say that it is fiction. Never would you think that someone achieving teleportation to another city is real. I must say though, Science has come a long way in such a short space of time. Asking if teleportation will ever become reality, is a good question to ask.\nTeleportation\nThe idea of teleportation is to change a physical object into a signal and transmit this signal to somewhere else where it is then reassembled. This has already been done\u2026kind of. By altering this definition by a small amount we have been able to teleport, yes.\nTeleportation in REAL LIFE\nIn fact, this altered definition of teleportation has recently allowed for scientists in China to teleport a photon from Earth into Space. Although a photon is not a physical object, it\u2019s a start, and could revolutionize all sorts of things which I will discuss later on. First, we must dive back into the realm of Quantum Physics to understand how this teleportation actually worked.\nThe Alien World of Quantum Physics\nIt doesn\u2019t sound nice, I know, but I will make this as understandable as I can for you readers. The problem with Quantum Physics, is that it defies logic. They say that if you believe that you understand Quantum Physics, then you don\u2019t understand it at all. The more you learn about it; the more it confuses you. Quantum Entanglement is certainly not an exception.\nQuantum Entanglement\nHaving said how crazy quantum can get; quantum entanglement is when you have two particles that are physically separated from each other \u2013 yet they still have some sort of connection between them [1]. This connection allows them to influence each other instantaneously \u2013 on any scale you want. Imagine you are here on Earth; and on the other side of the Universe you have a person who is \u2018entangled\u2019 to you \u2013 If you clap, the person on the other side of the Universe also claps\u2026 instantaneously.\nSounds completely alien right? Surprisingly, it has been proven with quantum particles over and over again. This is incredibly shocking, as on a large scale of distance, this passage of information would break the fastest possible speed in the Universe \u2013 the speed of light. This defies the laws of Physics. So how does this relate to how the scientists in China managed to teleport a photon 300 miles, from Earth into Space?\nQuantum Entanglement and Teleportation relation\nThis teleportation that the Scientists did, was not quite the disappearing of something that reappears elsewhere, magically \u2013 but the production of an exact copy of that something with its information, by the means of quantum entanglement. Let me explain.\nImagine looking into a mirror. If you wave your hand at it, your reflection waves back. In quantum entanglement terms; you are entangled with your reflection (\u2018entangled\u2019 means you are connected in a \u201cspooky\u201d way no one knows of yet) \u2013 so by altering your information (by waving), due to this entanglement, your reflection alters theirs instantly \u2013 producing an exact copy of your wave, thus, your reflection waves back at you. As a result, your waving hand has teleported to your reflection. Still don\u2019t get it? This very short video will definitely help you out.\nThis is how the photon was teleported into Space by the scientists. Mind bending, right? That\u2019s the Quantum world for you.\nWill teleportation on a large physical scale ever occur?\nWith the technology we now have, probably not. By using quantum entanglement \u2013 teleportation has been done with atoms, but not with anything bigger. It becomes too complex as you can imagine, but by no means am I saying it is impossible \u2013 it could be done.\nWhat can this quantum teleportation help us with if we were to achieve it?\nIf we can\u2019t teleport a McDonalds directly to our beds, what\u2019s the point of this so called \u2018achievement\u2019 \u2013 why is it a breakthrough? Turns out, this form of teleportation has a huge impact \u2013 especially in the world of computers. If data was teleported from computer to computer using quantum entanglement, it would be IMPOSSIBLE to hack that signal since it is nowhere in between the two computers, at all \u2013 therefore, you cannot grasp it [2].\nThis is a significant step into developing a quantum internet, which is an internet that is impossible to hack, an internet which transmits data instantly across the world. An internet where downloading and uploading speeds do not become a problem anymore. No more kicking your internet router \u2013 bid farewell to lag.\nThe innovation that is to happen in the future is very uncertain, and we are at the brink of doing amazing things we never thought of doing. Here\u2019s to the future. are Quantum Computers?\u201d \u2013 Episode 3 (FOR BEGINNERS!)\nWonders of Quantum Physics: \u201cWhat is Matter?\u201d \u2013 Episode 2\nCan We Download our Brains and Live FOREVER\nPrevious articles:\nWhat happens to you in Space without a Spacesuit?\nThe Science of Tanning: What does the Sun do to your Skin?\nWhat Makes a Rainbow?\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to my Newsletter to never miss an update!",

Turn right (south,) and in just over 2/10 of a mile turn right toward the campground. 1.1 miles further on, turn left onto forest road 19, which is unpaved. A sign at this junction points to Sky Mountain Camp if you were to go straight. You will drive along the eastern shore of Lake Valley Reservoir for a few miles, and after 4 miles turn left on road 38. A mile and a half past this point is privately owned Huysink Lake, which you will pass, and then 1/2 a mile past this is the parking area where the road bends sharply to the right. There are spots here for 5-6 cars on the left and 1-2 on the right.\nHazards of Note:\nThe first mile toward Salmon Lake is intermittently dusty and dirty.\nCrowd Factor:\nNegligible on the Salmon Lake trail until you hit Lower Loch Leven Lake. Then the crowd factor will be high, with many people visiting this area from the main trailhead near Big Bend (the next exit east of Yuba Gap.)\nGeneral Notes:\nFrom the parking at the trailhead, you will find the old trailhead signed just to the northwest of the bend in the road. Follow this trail past an unnamed lake about 1/2 a mile in on the left, and then look sharply for a sign pointing back to your car that indicates a mile to go back that way. An obvious trail heads south, which will allow you to reach Salmon Lake within about 3/10 of a mile. Head back and pick up the original Salmon Lake trail, and then when you reach Lower Loch Leven Lake you will turn right toward Middle Loch Leven Lake. Most people come in from the trail on the left at this junction.\nThe trail loops around the south end of Middle Loch Leven Lake, and then heads upward toward High Loch Leven Lake at the end of the trail this direction.\nTrailhead signs that are so old that the trees have started to grow back around them.\nThe first (unnamed) lake that you pass on your left. It is already showing signs of eventually becoming a meadow.\nSalmon Lake is just about 3/10 of a mile off the main trail. While it boasts no salmon, it is filled with minature catfish which were originally placed here by Chinese railroad workers for additional sustenance.\nLooking toward the south end of Salmon Lake from our catfish-feeding location.\nHiking up past the south end of Salmon Lake offers a great view far into American Canyon beyond.\nA very idyllic Lower Loch Leven Lake on this early morning.\nDoug, my hiking buddy for the day photo-bombing this shot of Middle Loch Leven Lake.\nOne of the many sunbathers we passed along the way.\nOne of the islands in Middle Loch Leven Lake.\nThe small cove at the south end of Middle Loch Leven Lake with a glassy smooth surface.\nJust a little bit off the trail was a great view of the Middle Loch Leven Lake that wouldn't have been spotted but for following the trail of a geocache.\nValidation that we had made it to our lunch destination.\nGetting one look at the lake showed that for me to grab the geocache I was after, I was going to have to get wet.\nOn my way to and from the island.\nOne more look south at the lakes area from High Loch Leven Lake.\nA view of our trail into the very green forest area as we headed back on Salmon Lake trail.\nGPX image of the hike.",

    "context": "A year from now, the American public will have the opportunity to elect a new president. A large fraction of citizens \u2014 usually between 40 and 50 percent \u2014 will decide not to vote. That alarms observers who consider low turnout a threat to the legitimacy of policymaking in democracies. Some of them worry that because voting and other forms of political participation are dropping, money matters more in politics. They argue that low turnout increases the effectiveness of campaign spending because it can be targeted at a smaller group of voters.\nTo counter the long-term decline in turnout, President Obama last March suggested mandatory voting, believing that \u201cit would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything.\u201d\nSo would election outcomes look different if we had virtually universal turnout?\nAnswering that seemingly straightforward question is quite challenging. To assess how turnout changes the results, we would ideally observe an election twice, once under high and once under low turnout. Which is, of course, impossible.\nIn a recent study \u2014 \u201cDoes Compulsory Voting Increase Support for Leftist Policy?\u201d\u2014 we try to find a way around this problem. We study federal referendums in Switzerland in the first half of the 20th century, examining referendum results in a treatment group and a comparable control group.\nOur treatment group consists of districts in the canton of Vaud where citizens who did not vote had to pay a substantial fine that was collected by the local police. In the control group, voting was voluntary. In both groups citizens voted on the same policy proposals in federal referendums. So how did compulsory voting affect policy choices?\nThe fine boosted referendum turnout by 30 percentage points \u2014 giving Vaud participation rates of up to 90 percent, exceptionally high levels of civic engagement.\nBut what were the policy consequences? We find that higher turnout caused stronger support for leftist, redistributive policy, for example, bills that proposed stricter market regulation and expanded welfare programs.\nThe figure below shows the evolution of support for leftist policy proposals for districts in Vaud (red line) and districts in the control cantons (blue line). The gray shaded area represents the period in which Vaud practiced compulsory voting. We see little difference in support for leftist policy proposals between districts in Vaud and districts in the control cantons \u2014 at least, until Vaud introduces a fine for failing to vote in 1925.\nMandatory voting changed referendum outcomes. As soon as authorities in Vaud introduced compulsory voting, electoral support for leftist policy increased by about 8 to 15 percentage points when compared to the cantons where there was no fine. The green line in the figure equals the difference in support for leftist policies between districts in Vaud and districts in the control cantons, adjusted for their differences before the introduction of compulsory voting.\nTaken together, these results suggest that compulsory voting not only increases turnout, but also mobilizes new voters whose preferences are sufficiently distinct to affect public policy.\nThese findings have implications for ongoing debates about the desirability of compulsory voting. If, for example, compulsory voting increased turnout but failed to change outcomes, low turnout would be more efficient as many citizens could save the costs of voting.\nOur results suggest that compulsory voting not only increases turnout, but also shifts support toward particular policies. Therefore, the efficiency argument does not seem convincing in the case we examine.\nOur results also answer a related question: Would mandatory voting lead to unstable political majorities, since it would bring to the polls a larger share of less-informed citizens who would vote more or less randomly on policies? After all, the opinions of those with less political knowledge could be more easily malleable.\nThat\u2019s not what we find. In our context, compulsory voting causes a stable increase in support for leftist policies, a finding that is difficult to square with the random voting argument.\nMichael Bechtel is SNSF professor of political science at the University of St. Gallen. Dominik Hangartner is associate professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the principal investigator of the Migration Policy Lab at the University of Zurich.

There is training on how to do this inside the IPAS2 training. Pretty cool!\nGenerally there are 2 primary methods of creating totally free leads within Facebook that have shown to be efficient.\nThe first method is to publish to Facebook groups. The majority of marketers simply post their affiliate link with some copy to a Facebook group. I find a more effective way is to post links to your blog posts, and then the blog posts have calls to action at the end of the article \u2026 after providing LOTS of value.\nThe 2nd totally free approach is starting conversations with individuals on Facebook, or in other words prospecting. This takes more effort but it is far more effective than posting links in Facebook groups. I have utilized this method a lot and it works.\nFacebook PPC\nWe discussed complimentary Facebook list building, so the next step is to discuss spending for clicks using Facebook (PPC, or Pay Per Click). I love Facebook PPC due to the fact that you can focus with laser accuracy in on your target customers. This indicates you\u2019ll be putting your offer right in front of certain purchasers. If you target your ads to speak to your audience you\u2019ll get more leads, and therefore more sales.\nIt is extremely advised that when you do Facebook PPC to have a free offer to entice individuals to offer you their e-mail address. I do not send them straight to my IPAS 2 offer \u2026 instead I such as to collect the emails first before sending them to the IPAS2 capture page. It is very important to obtain those emails since leads typically require an average of seven direct exposure before they purchase something.\nYouTube Promotion for IPAS2.\nI love video.\nVideo is a GREAT methods of both promoting and branding your products and yourself. With video people to get to know and trust you. You will begin to link with your target audience as you show that you are a REAL person.\nWe submit videos to YouTube on a regular basis. These videos can then be discovered by Google or the YouTube online search engine. We\u2019ll also imbed the videos into our blog site posts. I likewise advise submitting the exact same videos to your Facebook page if they are five minutes or less.\nConsist of a minimum of one link in your YouTube video description \u2026 ideally in the very first line of the description. Doing this will make sure that the link appears in YouTube search engine results page as a clickable URL. You can have your video link take individuals to your blog, a post, the root of your webpage, or a capture page. Explore different kinds of links \u2026 mix it up some. If the video is likewise embedded in an article then I will have the link going to the blog site post to show audiences where they can get more details on the video \u2026 then on your blog present lots of opportunities for them to decide into your subscriber list.\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Your Blog.\nWhen asked, \u201cways to create leads for the IPAS2 system?\u201d I will certainly inform them my favorite method is to use SEO.\nI love SEO. As soon as when you have on and off page SEO completed for a page or article, you can basically forget it and proceed to the next page or article unless it is an extremely competitive keyword (those require more upkeep).\nLet\u2019s say that gradually you get about 2 visitors a day per post (which is low if you are doing SEO correctly). After one year of consistent daily blogging you will certainly get 730 brand-new visitors a day! I am getting about 1-3 % of visitor traffic recorded as leads \u2026 so that would imply you could be gathering typically approximately 7 to 22 leads a day! And those pages will continuously produce those leads as you include more content the following year.\nThe SEO technique of getting leads is the sluggish way. That will keep bringing people on your list back to your web site (which will certainly increase your general traffic to your web site) so you can attempt and get them to buy.\nAnd if you carefully choose great keyword phrases for each post, you should have targeted traffic on your site that have a much better opportunity of desiring to buy something.\nIn addition to our article, I develop \u201cmoney pages.\u201d These extremely focused web pages generate particular, laser targetted traffic to our website. Normally these pages target harder keyword phrases and so I have to develop a lot more backlinks \u2026 but they can be worth it. As I write this I am getting in between 250-350 visitors a day simply for our IPAS 2 money page. Imagine what you can do if you have even 10 pages that brought in even 25-50 visitors a day \u2026 targeted visitors who are extremely near buying \u2026 and you will rapidly understand the power of SEO.\nIPAS2 Traffic Coop.\nThe IPAS 2 system consists of the capability to purchase clicks to your offer to your IPAS2 capture page. This is a fantastic way to get begun buying traffic for IPAS.\nI like the IPAS2 system\u2019s ability to assist you track where your clicks are originating from and whether those leads join your subscriber list or pay for the trial. This has assisted me to weed out poorer traffic sources. You can utilize this function yourself if you head out and buy your very own traffic.\nParting Words About How to Get Leads for IPAS 2.\nThere are a great deal of other ways to obtain leads, but this are the ones I feel most comfortable discussing.\nIf you target your advertisements to talk to your audience you\u2019ll get more leads, and for that reason more sales.\nIt is vital to get those emails because leads typically require an average of 7 direct exposure prior to they buy something.\nI am getting about 1-3 % of visitor traffic captured as leads \u2026 so that would suggest you could be gathering on average roughly 7 to 22 leads a day! The SEO method of getting leads is the slow method.\nTo find out more about IPAS2, look into this IPAS2 Review:.",

    "context": "All the Best News and Articles\nAbout\nArticle Writing\n\u00bb\nSales and Marketing\nPersonal Selling\nPublished: 17th August 2015\nViews: N/A\nTweet\nPersonal Selling is explained as a one-to-one interaction between the organisation's sales representative and the buyer/ potential buyer to influence and persuade them to make a purchase in a systematic, repetitive and measurable way. According to Jobber 2007, there are three types of personal selling techniques: -\na. Order Takers who only responds to the company's already committed/ loyal buyers.\nb. Order Creators who don't directly receive any order from the buyers but they persuade and encourage the channel members to push their products to their prospects.\nc. Order Getters are front line sales person who persuades the customers to make direct purchases.\nPersonal Selling follows a five stage process of selling: -\nStage I: - Prospecting: - Identifying the target market based upon the need, expectations and desires of the buyer.\nStage II: - Making First Contact: - It involves the preparation done by the sales representative before they meet their potential buyer. A good sales person identifies the objective, the expectation, the expected result, purpose of the visit/call, timing of making the visit/ call, information to be conveyed and preparation that they require before meeting the buyer.\nStage III: - Making Sales Call/ Presentation: - While making actual sales visit/ call the sales person must remember that they are focused, enthusiastic, calm, cool, confident, relaxed and have adequate product knowledge to list the benefits of buying the product, encourage queries, feedbacks and allow the customers to participate in the interaction process.\nStage IV: - Objection handling: - It refers to the technique through which sales person handles client's queries, questions and obstacles. The sales person should be tactful, courteous, calm, confident and respectful in handling such objections even if they are difficult to handle and tackle.\nStage V: - Closing the sale: - It is vital for any sales person to successfully close a deal so it is necessary for them to know the art of closing any sales call/ visit like asking when to call next, whether to place their order, encouraging feedback, identifying body language of the buyer, summarising the discussion, encouraging opportunities for future meeting etc.\nFollowing are the definitions of Personal Selling: -\n1. The presentation of a persuasive message by a seller to a potential customer or group of customers, generally in a face-to-face meeting. Personal selling can also take place through personal correspondence, telephone conversations, or emails.\n2. Personal selling is a promotional method in which one party (e.g., salesperson) uses skills and techniques for building personal relationships with another party (e.g., those involved in a purchase decision) that results in both parties obtaining value.\n3. Face to face interaction with one or more perspective purchasers for the purpose of making presentations, answering questions, and procuring orders\" - Philip Kotler.\n4. Face-to-face selling in which a seller attempts to persuade a buyer to make a purchase.\n5.\nRole/ Importance of Personal Selling: -\n1. It helps to establish personal contacts and relations between the buyers and the organisation's sales representative.\n2. There is verbal communication between both the parties and hence product information can be easily exchanged. Various product characteristics like price, colour, shape, design, technique, warranty, and service/delivery / installation issues can be easily demonstrated by the Sales Person to the possible buyer.\n3. Doubts, queries of the buyer can be solved immediately and the Sales Person can receive immediate feedback, ideas, solutions, views, know about the likes, dislikes, taste, preferences of their buyer or potential buyer.\n4. The objective of Personal Selling is not only to inform, persuade, and intimate the buyer but also to make actual sales of products/ services so the ultimate end objective of increasing sales of any organisation is achieved through Personal Selling.\n5. The Sales Person can adopt a unique selling technique for each buyer according to their expectations and situations hence it is dyadic in nature and can analyse to how to sell to the satisfy the needs of the buyer.\n6. It fosters two-way communication process where message is conveyed and feedback is received immediately.\n7. It is a two way proactive and dynamic process rather than reactive and passive form of communication.\n8. Through Personal Selling, the organisation can provide detailed information about their products/ services, advantages, unique features, availability, unique attributes of the product, special instructions about the product/ services.\n9. Personal Selling enables the organisation o reach a more defined and concentrated market and approach their target market effectively\n10. It educates and builds brand awareness among their potential target market about the new offerings to the organisation.\n11. It aids other promotional technique like Advertising, Public Relations and Publicity. Advertising informs the buyers about the company's product/ services but Personal Selling persuades the customers to buy the products.\n12. It is considered as an appropriate technique in selling complex items like financial services, automobiles, office equipment's like photocopier etc.\n13. The Sales Personal needs the right attitude, appearances, body language and specialised product knowledge.\n14. Point-of-Sale-Merchandising is often considered as a specialised form of Personal Selling. It involves face-to-face interaction between Sales Person of the organisation and the retail trader. The purpose is to encourage Retail trader to stock company's product and induce them to sell the products to their buyers/ target market.\n15.

    "context": "A recent survey of Canadian workers by pension consulting firm Towers Watson found that economic uncertainty is fueling fears among workers that they won\u2019t have adequate income in retirement. This has made employee savings plans increasingly valued by employees of small businesses, as well as an increasingly important benefit that employers can use to attract and retain good long-term workers.\nThe survey found 50 per cent of workers with a traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan, which pays a guaranteed level of income in retirement, identified their pension plan as a key reason for joining their current employer.\nBut just 30 per cent of workers whose companies have a defined contribution (DC) plan or a group RRSP said the programs were a key factor in taking their jobs. Those plans, which are more prevalent in the private sector, do not pay a guaranteed level of income in retirement but to 50 percent with DC pension plans.\nThe findings reinforce the fact that companies with DB pension plans can achieve a more stable work force than those with a DC plan, and suggests companies with traditional pensions should highlight that advantage to prospective employees.\nThe survey also found that one third of Canadian employees would be willing to sacrifice part of their pay in return for enhanced retirement security, and one in four would give up a bonus in exchange for additional retirement benefits.\nThe fact that so many workers would trade pay for better retirement security is an indicator of the significant unease that employees have about their ability to save for retirement. The obvious benefit of a payroll savings plan is that it fits the \u201dpay yourself first\u201d process that financial advisors promote, as money comes off one\u2019s paycheck tax free into an RRSP before it gets spent on other things. Plus regular monthly deposits into an RRSP are a much more efficient way to build savings with the significant benefit of dollar cost averaging over lump sum contributions.\nImage licensed through Shutterstock",

But the reality is, everyone will come out the stronger for it.\nOn Thursday, Traci went in to see her doctors because her Hickman Catheter site was infected. It actually appeared a few weeks back, but then antibiotics began to clear up the infection. But once the antibiotics had run there course, the site became infected again, and the doctors wanted to pull it out. (In case you don\u2019t know what a Hickman is, check it out here). The reality is, a Hickman should only be in for 6-8 months before they should be removed because of the risk of infection. Traci\u2019s had hers for well over a year. It was just time to remove it.\nThe hospital was full however. So instead of admitting her, and getting her a room, they sent her down to the ER to wait in the hall with everyone else who has a whooping cough and the swine flu. Turns out, that\u2019s not so good for someone with a compromised immune system (another attribute incurred from cancer patients having undergone Chemo), and we fought to get a room. The nurses were actually really great and stole a room for us as soon as one became available. The reality was, the hallways were lined with patients because the ER was so jam-packed. So getting a room was really a luxury.\nBut there in the ER, Traci sat. We waited, and waited for availability in the OR to remover the Hickman, and they kept coming in and saying \u201cthere was a trauma, and we couldn\u2019t get you in.\u201d Or, \u201cwe just had to bump you, and you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer.\u201d It was frustrating as her last meal was at 11AM on Thursday. Finally, I left at 4AM Friday morning because I still had to get the kids to school.\nFriday came and went, and I got done with work and picked up the kids from Girl Scouts and dropped them at home with Traci\u2019s grandparents. When I got back to the hospital at around 7PM, I found out that Traci had still not been offered anything to eat. I took out my anger at the Doctors and the Nurses there in the ER. Right there in the Nurses Station, I very loudly began to berate them for their lack of care, their inability to pay attention to a patient, and their sheer neglect for Traci as a person. It had been over 30 hours and she hadn\u2019t been offered anything to eat. It was unacceptable, and I lost it. I screamed at the Doctors that they were Hitler, running this show and treating these patients worse than Jews in a concentration camp. I demanded that they get on the line with surgery and either get her in there now, or let her eat. The latter took place in moments.\nOn Saturday morning, Traci was set to have the IR attempt to install a new Pick line. This was difficult simply because prior to getting the Hickman, the doctors preferred that she get a Pick Line. But because the Graph vs. Host disease has attacked her skin so violently, and because her veins are so small, a Pick line was nearly impossible to install. After several failed attempts the last time, the physicians and surgeons finally relented and agreed to install the Hickman. Fortunately this time, a good vein was found on her right bicep, and after several tries, the surgeon finally was able to install the line. And later that evening, she went into the OR to have the infected Hickman Catheter removed.\nEverything went smoothly. Traci was incredible through it all. She had a really positive attitude saying things like \u201cwell, thank goodness it was this weekend. I\u2019d rather have it now than over Emma\u2019s birthday, or the Wedding, or the Bridal Shower.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe how great she was. There was of course the occasional crying, and there were plenty of complaints about the eating (or lack there of), but overall, I was amazed by her positive attitude and positive outlook on the whole situation. It was encouraging.\nI also want to thank all of my friends who kept asking about how things were going, both through text and on twitter. It was extremely peaceful to have those positive affirming messages come through, just checking on us both. Your thoughts and prayers were absolutely felt, welcomed, and totally appreciated.\nMother\u2019s Day was a day of recovery from the procedures. Traci is today in bright spirits. I brought her kids in to see her and visit for a while along with a Mom\u2019s Day flower arrangement. It was a good time.\nNow that things have settled down, I\u2019m hopeful that Traci will be home by Tuesday. And the healing should have come far enough along that we can resume some form of normalcy. I\u2019m missing that at the moment. I don\u2019t like coming home to an empty house, or sleeping in a bed alone. I miss my partner. And I\u2019ll be happy to have her home.\nSome takeaways from all of this, a moral if you will; I\u2019m so appreciative of life. It\u2019s something that I think that all of us take for granted. It\u2019s a gift. The ability to simply exist every day, and the ability to love. There are so many trivial things that can affect us every day, and damper our moods and our outlooks on life. I think that it\u2019s important that we remember that the fact that we\u2019re here to begin with is a miracle itself. I came away from this weekend simply happy that I have so many loved ones in my life. Thankful that my children are healthy and happy. And thankful that the woman that I am going to marry is going to come home. Everything else just seems to me to be less important. I\u2019m not worried about the fact that I\u2019m still behind two months in pay from my employer. I\u2019m not worried about the trivial things in life. I intend on focusing on those items that bring about joy in my life, and that of others.\nMost Recent Comments",

    "context": "Feeling a little worn out today.\nIt\u2019s already been a long week, and I\u2019m not even quite halfway done with it.\nBetween all the up-and-down at work, and my new work-out regimen at home, I\u2019m whipped most nights, and ready to just fall in bed and collapse. Of course, it feels pretty good to have a couple of the women at work tell me that they can see that I\u2019ve lost some weight, so I\u2019m going to keep doing what I\u2019m doing, and work on getting stronger and in better shape.\nYoungerDaughter had her first swim meet yesterday. The link is to a short, 30-second video of one of her races, in which she came in 3rd.\nIt was just among their own squad, so it was a good start for the girls to get an idea of where they fit in the team, as well as determining baseline times, so they can watch themselves improve over the year.\nI love watching her swim, but I do have to admit, it\u2019s hard being there\u2026 without my friend, Midnite. She always used to go to the swim meets with me, and we\u2019d cheer ourselves hoarse watching Younger kick her way down the lanes. It was a bittersweet moment, sitting there alone, but I know that Midnite was there with me, cheering her on.\nSchool for both kids is still about 2 weeks away. And as it draws closer, OnlySon is getting almost desperate to hang on to his \u201cvacation\u201d state of mind. I\u2019ve told him that bedtime is going to be earlier, wake-up time is going to be earlier, and soon, he\u2019s going to have to get himself out of bed using his alarm clock. And that if he can\u2019t get out of bed on his own, his bedtime will be backed up by half an hour \u2013 until he can. He\u2019s certainly old enough now to be responsible enough to get up on his own.\nAnd I\u2019ll still be driving him to school, for now, as it\u2019s on my way to work. But soon enough, he\u2019ll have to ride the city bus to school. He cringes every time I mention it, but once he reaches his freshman year, he\u2019ll be riding the bus every morning. YoungerDaughter is going to take a few days, as soon as we get the bus route schedule figured for Only\u2019s new school, and help him get used to the routine of riding. At least this way, he\u2019ll have someone he\u2019s familiar with helping him, instead of getting thrown into it blind.\nWe\u2019ll see how it goes. Either it\u2019ll be a huge success, with Only gaining another area where he\u2019s able to be independent, or he\u2019ll get scarred for life by the trauma of riding in a bus full of strangers. I\u2019m rooting for no psychological damage, and a huge grin when he gets to finally start doing some of these big steps on his own.\nIndependence \u2013 GOOD. Emotional Trauma \u2013 BAD.\nSee?

    "context": "A Little Goes A Long Way\nWhen Katherine Commale was just 5 years old, she saw a program on TV about how malaria was taking the lives of Africans every 30 seconds. She didn\u2019t understand why people in Africa had to suffer when all they needed were bed nets \u2013 her child-like logic brought her to a simple solution: send bed nets to Africa..NOW! To her, the solution seemed so easy but it greatly affected her to know that something costing as little as $10 was not accessible by the poverty-stricken people in Africa. Instead of settling for the age-old \u201cit is only happening to other people, not me\u201d attitude, Katherine felt compelled to help them and did whatever she could to spread the message even if the task was too big for a five year old.\nWhile most kids could not yet fully understand what suffering meant, Katherine Commale did and saw the importance in reaching out to the children in Africa. Her pure and giving heart drove her to help these strangers miles away, hoping to give them a chance to live better lives without the fear of malaria. With the help of her mother, Lynda, Katherine began giving talks at her local church and community about the disease; she wanted everyone to know the deadliness of the disease but most of all, she wanted people to know that the solution was only one bed net away. She even went the extra mile to create a diorama with her three year old brother to illustrate her message so everyone \u2013 without exception \u2013 will be inspired to help. For most of us, it may never occur to us that our bed nets were precious assets but Katherine stood up and made us realize that it could save someone\u2019s life.\nRather than spending her holidays having fun like other kids her age, Kathrine chose to use the holiday season to show everyone what the spirit of giving really means. Gathering her neighbours and friends together, they made hand-decorated bed net gift certificates to be sold and then gifted to someone in Africa. This small yet powerful gesture allowed her to send over 750 bed nets every holiday \u2013 a remarkable number that sparked the beginning of even bigger things. Before she was even 6 years old, Katherine\u2019s passion has lead her to become the spokeskid for UN\u2019s Nothing But Nets campaign and was invited to speak for both President Bush and President Clinton respectively among many other commercials and newspaper appearances \u2013 a role model not just for young children to aspire for greater things but for adults to never stop dreaming.\nKatherine\u2019s selfless deed in championing against malaria showed us that a little goes a long way and that age is really only a number. It also showed us that you don\u2019t always need a reason to be kind and generous to someone but instead it should come as second nature to share our joys with everyone around us. The joy of giving may not strike a chord with many at first but it is time we thought about what we can do to make the world a better place rather than waiting for someone to do it for you. Here are some small ways you can give to start making a difference:\nGive the gift of compassion\nEveryone you meet everyday has a story of their own. How they react and how they present themselves is a reflection of their inner self. Often times, we are creatures quick to judge and we start making our own conclusions about them; but instead, remember that these people have their struggles too and show some kindness because you don\u2019t know who might need it. Like the quote says \u201cDon\u2019t judge people, you never know what kind of battles they are fighting\u201d.\nDuplicate your love\nWe all have a little love to give someone and showing a little TLC can never hurt anybody. Instead of keeping all the love to yourself, share it! Share it with everyone around you and it doesn\u2019t even have to be physical gifts. You can give a sincere smile or help a lady cross the street \u2013 anything. So long as you are extending your hand to someone, a little will always go a long way. Just like Katherine has duplicated her love to the people in Africa, you can do it too.\nShow gratitude to everyone\nf you have ever worked retail, you will know that a kind and polite customer is always the highlight of your day even if it was something as simple as a warm \u201cThank you\u201d. Showing your gratitude and gratefulness doesn\u2019t take anything from you but instead, it adds a new shared connection between two people \u2013 even if just for a moment. People will never turn away an opportunity to feel noticed and appreciated, so make someone\u2019s day and let them know their efforts are seen.\nShare your fortunes\nIf you are broke, don\u2019t worry; fortunes, like giving, can come in all forms. You can share your fortunate talent in baking by blessing your friends with quality cookies or if you are fortunate enough to have a car, pick up a colleague and carpool together! It\u2019s these details that we often overlook \u2013 but it\u2019s these small things that matter. Never think that you have nothing to offer because hey, you are fortunate to have a beautiful smile, so you can do that, can\u2019t you?",

Like a game of 4 dimensional chess we can start to make the connections. The 1962 Northwoods document has all ingredients showing how to make an expert false flag operation. A blueprint, only to be adapted to each new event and circumstances.\nIn short: Propaganda, psychological warfare and patsies. They are the 3 P's already found in Hitlers Intelligence, and Operation Paperclip provided the human resources to it, where some 700 former SS specialists were recruited to form the basis for the CIA.\nSome similarities are strikingly arrogant: in both the London Bombings as in the 9/11 event, there were training sessions based on the exact same scenario as the actual event, meaning: all personel needed for the stage was on site. All their minds were set for the event. But furthermore, it would cause immense confusion. Already in 1962 the US military talked about using fake airplanes and even radio-controled airplanes. Already in 1962 they talked about staged events Hollywood style.\nImagine how in 40 years technology has developed and what new technology could do.\nImagine the amount of bombs the US has dropped on Earth related to these events.\nImagine the amount of money being involved and how easy it is to make taxpayers pay.\nImagine the effects on the worldmarkets, spreading fear and conditioning the minds of virtually every person on this globe.\nImagine the hatred coming from propaganda and continuous exposure to violence (TV, computer war games).\nIt is a slow, but steady operation. Divide and Conquer. And there was more to come, Mumbai, Financial Market collapse...\nAll of this means, that this will be the Age of Truth: is President Obama the change for the good, or is he the change for even worse?\nIn conclusion:\nWhen you look at a piece of classical music, when you look at the design of a complicated building, when you look at the plot of a really good movie or when you look at a painting, you'll see different structures, different lines, different accents, which, together make the whole thing come together as one. However, within strategic politics there's another level added to this complicated structure, it's the chess game. Together with psychology, mass psychology, propaganda techniques and hidden agenda's it becomes a \"game\" that most people can not understand and the easy way out is simply: denial.\nWhen you break down the Northwoods document in it's structure(s) and elements you will find the blueprint of every other staged event the USA military has performed within the last, let's say, 50 years.\nIn 1962 they thought about \"staged events\", fake airplanes, remote controled airplanes, psychological games to trick the UN, the Cuban people, the media, the American people, etc.\nHitler did the same with the Reichstag. The same goes with Vietnam, and before that even Pearl Harbor. In their documents the New World Order (they have a website, P.N.A.C., \"Project for the New American Century\") spoke about \"a new Pearl Harbor\", being an event to trigger a war in Iraq/Iran.\nIn 2005 the London bombings had the same characteristics as 9/11: there were warnings before the attack (conditioning the minds of people involved), there were drills following the EXACT same scenario as what really happened, which caused immense confusion with everyone involved. There was a security company involved that also was attached to an explosives (demolition) company. The moment was politically very important because there was a lot of discussion going on about the withdrawal of British troops. Well, this goes on and on.\nThe age of internet and bare-secrecy gives an illusion of freedom of information. But where are the pictures from the 88 camera's around the Pentagon? Why did Bush \"testify\" without taking an outh (very Christian...) + without recorders + only together with his brother in crime + a biased commision (from the Bush Administration)?\n~LW\nAbonneren op: Reacties posten (Atom)\nGeen opmerkingen:\nEen reactie posten",

    "context": "If you\u2019ve been reading this blog for some time, you\u2019ll remember I previously referred to attempting book tours using our RV. In October, 2015, I wrote of the breakdown of the Forest River Windsong stranding us first in Bullhead City AZ then Las Vegas NV. Findlay\u2019s in Las Vegas hit us for numerous parts and labor, including a new radiator, then dusted their hands of it. You may have wondered what happened with the situation and whether or not we sold the motorhome. You won\u2019t believe the story. You can\u2019t make this stuff up.\nThe Foothills area of Yuma AZ is an absolute delight and this is where hubby decided the RV was going. Yuma is a \u201cwinter visitor\u201d paradise. We made it to Yuma.\nSaid hubby then decided he needed a job to pay for all the debt the MoHo incurred and obtained his CDL by March 2015. Within a week, he was gainfully employed by a trucking firm out of Phoenix. We drove the RV to Goodyear, secured an RV spot and off he went. As sure as April follows March and summer follows spring, temperatures in an RV can climb faster than rabbits in heat. Time to sell.\nCraig\u2019s List almost immediately began returning inquiries of interest and quickly became scary. With the main man gone and my enthusiasm to try to show the aging behemoth waning, I yanked the ad and began looking at alternative ideas. It was obvious I\u2019d need to be out of the unit, and the RV was still mechanically challenged.\nOne of the park employees agreed to drive it to an RV consignment dealer in Mesa after I found an apartment. It was the first week of July and hot by 7 am. Instead of trying to sell it, however, the dealer determined he must first solve the temp problem and spent the 3 months on consignment performing repairs, quickly mounting to another grand.\nThe situation was becoming desperate with the consignment period ending and the dealer pushing for money. On Monday, I determined it was time to go back to the park and see if (1), they ever needed rentals, or (2) would they allow me to store it in their space at the back of the park. Short answer: no.\nThe helpful lady behind the counter, however, took a description of the RV, my asking price, and my phone number. By Thursday I had a call of interest. Shazam! What could go wrong?\nThe \u201cbuyer\u201d (we\u2019ll call him \u201cSam\u201d) said he would check it out and have \u201chis mechanic\u201d look at it on Tuesday. But Sam looked at it immediately and called again to negotiate price\u2013absolute bottom\u2013\u201cwhat will you take\u201c? (I cut my price) By Sunday, another call. He was ready to go get it, \u201chad the cash,\u201d was ready to purchase, and wanted to do the deal on Monday morning. He\u2019d call by 10. After 11, Sam called that his mechanic had looked it over and he was ready.\nDuring the drive to Mesa, I had two calls from Sam\u2019s wife. Arriving, I gave her my file and a \u201cBill of Sale,\u201d thinking she\u2019d sign and hand to Sam. The manager of the company produced my ownership certificate and we became engaged in a discussion of where to sign off (an out\nof state pink slip). In the meantime, the fella who was hanging back (assumed to be \u201cthe mechanic\u201c) began counting out money to Sam, who then counted money to me. (The woman explained on the phone they had come up just a little short (??) and he would be loaning them the difference so I could have my money.) I counted money to the dealer.\nThe couple then made a fast exit, leaving the \u201cthe mechanic\u201d who explained he was getting a tow truck. (Huh?) Taking it out to the parking lot, a discussion ensued regarding the couple. \u201cThe mechanic\u201d had purchased the unit, not the couple. He thought they were my friends; I thought his. They\u2019d explained to him it was their unit but I held the ownership certificate! We took the discussion to the consignment dealer who told us Sam talked to him after he\u2019d called me. Sam had immediately driven to Mesa where he looked it over, took pictures, and then told the dealer he\u2019d bring his mechanic to see it.\nBottom line; the real buyer paid the original asking price, but it didn\u2019t all go to me. The intervening couple pocketed the difference\u2013several thousand dollars. Who gave them my number? \u00a92016 Virginia Williams\n3 thoughts on \u201cHow I Sold the RV\u201d\nIt\u2019s actually a great and useful piece of info.

Paul Wall and about 250 of his closest friends celebrated his 34th birthday with a concert at Warehouse Live Wednesday night. The bar lines were very short, but people were still feeling good from all the smoke and the lean.\nFans who showed up for the celebration had high expectations for the evening after battling the stormy weather. Many also had the high hopes of seeing a preview of the \"Welcome to Houston\" FPSF collab, but would leave disappointed. Michael \"5000\" Watts and a couple of other DJs worked current Southern hip-hop for the crowd that trickled in, before the live performers finally hit the stage 15 minutes after midnight.\nThe first two acts consisted of guys rapping over their own tracks. The crowd was uninspired, and the white noise of audience chatter filtered through the sets. Whatever fans on the front row who weren't talking appeared bored. They wanted the People's Champ!\nThe crowd started to accumulate around the stage as the first billed artist, Nessacary, began to perform. Early in the set a huge arc of people surrounded the female rapper, and her DJ requested that everyone on the stage who was not a performer to back up. Her performance came across flat, but was slightly improved by the moves of her dancers.\nYoung Dolph came out next as Paul Wall finally made an appearance at the edge of the crowded stage with almost everyone having styrofoam cups filled with what one would believe to be drank. As Dolph did his thing, the grilled maestro smiled, showing the sparkles off his grill. Standing next to him was local celebrity and jewelry dealer, Johnny Dang. They were throwing up the H for the city that they love and represent while having a great time around their friends. The MC out of Memphis got the small Wednesday night crowd moving.\nThe Po-up Poet only spit a few verses on \"Texas Kool Aid\" with Young Dolph before he disappeared back stage and the DJ said good night. The look on the faces of the people on the front row was that of confusion. This event was quite disappointing, for Wall's fans that expected him to perform. All in all, the Swishahouse star spent about 25 minutes onstage surrounded by his crew. But despite the fact that the people didn't get more of the champ, Young Dolph put on a solid performance.\nPersonal Bias: Really wanted to see the King of All Bling, TVJohnny, perform \"Stay Iced Up\" with his business partner.\nThe Crowd: Folks who weren't afraid of getting wet in the rain.\nOverheard In the Crowd: \"The only time 40 people onstage is a good thing is when those 40 people are the Wu-Tang Clan.\" Dallas Trolls Say Their Hip-Hop Is Better Than Houston's Houston's 10 Best All-Ages Music Venues Houston's Top 10 Hookup Bars Houston's Top 10 Hip-Hop Clubs\nFollow @hprocksoff\nOr sign in with a social account:FACEBOOK GOOGLE + TWITTER YAHOO!",

    "context": "Do we really need renter's insurance?\nRenter's Insurance for a First Apartment?\nby Dollar Stretcher Contributors\nRenter's Insurance for a First Apartment?\nI found several helpful articles on the Dollar Stretcher site for determining the costs of renting a first apartment, but I did not see much mention of renter's insurance. Is this something I should be considering? I am getting ready to move into my first apartment, and although I do not have too many possessions at this time, I wonder if I would be wise to go ahead and get it. Or would it just be a waste of money at this point? I do have student loans I am working to pay off, so my budget is a little tight. What would other renters suggest? If you have renter's insurance, have you found it worth the cost, even if just for the peace of mind?\nMichael\nPay for the Renter's Insurance\nA friend of mine did not get renter's insurance for her apartment. Another tenant's unit caught on fire, and the whole apartment building burned to the ground. My friend was home with her husband and her baby. They had to climb out of a window and down a tree. The only things they had left were themselves and their car. She had to replace furniture and clothing, but also little things like scissors. She said that it was so difficult to replace it all and really regrets not paying for the insurance. It feels like you do not have much until it is all gone and have to replace it all.\nBeth\nInsurance May Be Required\nWhile some apartments still say renter's insurance is optional, there are many apartments are now saying you must have renter's insurance. Get it with the same company you have your car insurance with and you'll get a discount.\nBetty M.\nAbsolutely Buy Renter's Insurance\nIt is relatively inexpensive and will not only provide peace of mind but also pay off if you are robbed, have a fire, or someone is injured in your first apartment. I bought when I was young, on a budget, and paying student loans.\nBarbara\nTemporary House if First Apartment Is Lost\nRenter's insurance covers your belongings for theft and loss due to fire. Although you don't have much, you should consider what it would cost to replace everything if there is a fire. Also, where would you go if you lost everything? Insurance generally covers temporary housing until you get back on your feet after a loss. Renter's insurance is usually very inexpensive. Call a couple of independent agents to get prices. At that point, you can decide what is best for you based on your needs and income.\nCindy\nCover Your Electronics\nIf you have any electronics (laptop, iPhone, etc.), these would be covered. Renter's insurance is not that expensive because you are just insuring the contents. Imagine replacing all of your clothes and shoes. When we were renters many years ago, we lived in three separate places that had fires near our unit. You cannot always control the apartments around you (candles, grills, etc.). I say peace of mind is worth the small cost they will charge you.\nDebby\nCalculator: Home Budget Calculator\nNeed Renter's Coverage If Someone Is Hurt in First Apartment\nEvery renter should have renter's insurance. Not only does it cover replacing your furniture, dishes, clothing, etc., but it also covers staying at a hotel and eating out if your place is uninhabitable, liability insurance if someone is injured at your place, and items stolen from your home or car.\nJ & B\nCould You Replace All Possessions In Your First Apartment?\nAs far as buying renter's insurance, some building complexes require all renters to purchase it. The landlord should state in the lease if it's required. If it's not, the lease may state that all possessions of the renter are the renter's responsibility if a hazard (fire, earthquake, etc.) should occur that damages the possessions.\nTherefore, see if it's a requirement first. If not, check to see how much a policy would cost versus the cost of replacing all of your possessions. If it's within your budget and at a reasonable price, then buy it.\nRU\nShop Around and Do the Math\nLandlord's have landlord insurance to cover the cost of the structure. Renter's insurance merely covers your belongings in the place you rent in the event it is destroyed. Compare the replacement cost to the cost of the renter's insurance. If it costs more than it would to replace the items, then just put the money you would use for the insurance aside. On the other hand, if it costs more to replace the items than the insurance, it may be worth the money. Shop around and do the math to make a wise decision\nTerri\nAdvice From an Insurance Agent and a Renter\nI just rented my first apartment, and I am also an insurance agent. I would highly recommend getting renter's insurance. If you already have auto insurance, I recommend checking into renter's insurance through them as many times you will receive a discount on your auto policy that almost pays for the renter's insurance policy. Also something most do not know is that a good renter's insurance policy will also help reimburse you for expenses incurred if you have to leave your apartment due to a fire or other severe damage. This in itself has helped many of my customers. My policy covers me for $30,000 on contents, and I pay about $100 for the year.\nTracy R.\nTake the Next Step:\n- See why you need a home inventory.\n- Get off to a smart financial start.

    "question": "What are some of the benefits of having renter's insurance for a first apartment?",
    "answer": "Renter's insurance covers belongings for theft and loss due to fire, provides temporary housing in case of a loss, covers electronics, and provides liability insurance if someone is injured at the place. It also covers expenses like staying at a hotel and eating out if the place becomes uninhabitable. Some policies also help reimburse expenses incurred if one has to leave the apartment due to severe damage.",

    "context": "It is used for a variety of ailments, ESPECIALLY including pain, inflammation, and arthritis. With these problems, you simply drop a few drops at the affected site and rub it into the skin. Improvement usually occurs very rapidly and repeat applications increase the effectiveness and recovery time. There is no real limit to the number of applications that can be applied.\nI have used it as a carrier to enhance the deep penetration and absorption of certain topical herbal solutions that are joint, connective tissue and/or membrane targeted. Example: I tore the supraspinatus (shoulder tendon) while playing competitive basketball at the age of 53. It was such a serious tear that I was unable to move my arm 1 inch away from my body while hanging at my side. I was told that I would need surgery, months of rehabilitation, steroids and at least one year before I might expect a partial, perhaps 90% recovery. I declined \"modern medicine\" as usual and took matters into my own hands and trusting the experience, knowledge and most of all direct help that comes from the GREAT PHYSICIAN. Meanwhile a younger b-ball co-player had suffered the same injury 3 months prior. He had already had his surgery, a big scar, physical therapy and some drugs. He wasn't doing so well and was amazed that a man nearly 25 years his senior was showing signs of recovery that he was not able to match. (Not to mention the pain problem he suffered)\nI attribute my COMPLETE recovery, (I am able to military press 145 pounds 10 times without extreme effort) and was playing basketball competitively at 6 months after injury... to Soor Balm, some other topical herbal solution and various methods of rehabilitation that I developed myself with the guidance of the Great Physician.\nSoor Balm should be used on burns, cuts, and sprains and provides relief almost immediately, lasting up to 6 hours. A swollen sprained ankle will show signs of the reduction of swelling within one hour and there is no other known treatment I am aware of that can make this claim.\nAny auto-immune health problem can be greatly benefited by the use of Soor Balm. This also applies to anyone that has suffered stroke or other types of brain injuries.\nSoor Balm can be taken internally as well as topically.. Soor Balm hooks on to those molecules and they are then expelled from the body.\nSoor Balm.\nSoor Balm promotes the excretion of urine and functions as a muscle relaxant. It boosts the immune system, increasing the production of white cells and macrophages that destroy foreign material and pathogens in the body. It also has anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal properties. Soor Balm also increases the permeability of cell membranes, allowing a flushing of toxins from the cell.\nSoor Balm has radioprotective properties against lethal and mutagenic effects of X-rays in cells, cellular systems and whole animals. It also has cryoprotective properties, meaning that it is capable of protecting against injury due to freezing.\nAs a source of sulfur, Soor Balm aids in heavy metal detoxification. Sulfur binds with toxic heavy metals (mercury, lead, aluminum, cadmium, arsenic, nickel) and eliminates them via urination, defecation and sweating.",
    "question": "What are the various uses and benefits of Soor Balm as mentioned in the context?",
    "answer": "Soor Balm is used for a variety of ailments, especially including pain, inflammation, and arthritis. It can be applied topically at the affected site and can be used repeatedly.

    "context": "ARE OUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AGING US??0\nWe all use them, everyday, shampoo, conditioner, shaving gels, lotions, soaps, body washes, cosmetics and toiletries of all kinds\u2026BUT\u2026Are all these products safe?? Are they really slowing down our ageing process, or is our body dealing with an increased toxic load, therefore speeding up the ageing process?? This is the question I find I am asking myself these days. We all know that decreasing our toxic load makes for a healthier body environment, less risk of disease, and optimal cellular health. As a Registered Holistic Nutritionist I am always aware of and warning clients of the toxins they ingest in their foods\u2026but what about the toxins they absorb through their skin?? With a surface area of about 16 to 22 square feet, skin is far more than merely a protective barrier. Your skin is an organ, and it serves to regulate excretion of metabolic waste products & toxins, regulates temperature, and includes receptors for pain, tactile sensation, and pressure. Just as it excretes toxins, it can absorb toxins, and or nutrients efficiently. It takes approximately 26 seconds for anything that has contacted your skin to absorb into your blood stream! This was first brought to my attention by a client whose child had reacted to dairy products found in skin care\u2026it got me thinking about what else may be in our skin care regime. Recently David Suzuki listed 12 toxic ingredients in our self care products we should avoid. If we know these chemicals are toxic, why does Health Canada allow the use of them at all??\nIn Canada, Health Canada officials ensure that the product does not contain a substance found on\nthe Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist. The Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist: A List of Restricted and Prohibited Cosmetic Ingredients in Canada is another new important safety feature. There are over 500 ingredients on this list which manufacturers must limit or not put in their cosmetic products.\nThis sounds great\u2026right??? Wrong, our \u201chotlist\u201d includes only a few of the toxic ingredients out there.\nWhen compared to the European Safety Standards, The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and the EWG state the EU has banned 1,342 cosmetic ingredients!!\nWhat do you think of what is going on in this situation??? Why would Health Canada allow things like Phthalates in products we put on our skin?? Phalates classified Phalates as a suspected endocrine disruptor on the basis of evidence that it interferes with hormone function, and as toxic to reproduction on the basis that it may cause harm to the unborn child and impair fertility. Health Canada recently announced regulations banning six phthalates in soft vinyl children\u2019s toys and child care articles, but its use in cosmetics is not restricted. How does this make any sense? If we can absorb the toxin by ingestion, what stops us from absorbing it through our skin? The worst part\u2026you probably won\u2019t even see it listed as an ingredient on your skin care products!! Phthalates are often used as fragrance ingredients in many cosmetics, but consumers won\u2019t find these listed on the label. Fragrance recipes are considered trade secrets, so manufacturers are not required to disclose fragrance chemicals in the list of ingredients!! There is an interesting documentary regarding a factory that emits Phthalates in Sarnia, Ontario called the disappearing male. It documents the lower rate at which males are being born in the area and links it to the Phthalate levels in the area.\nInternational regulations are stronger. The European Union bans phthalates in cosmetics, as well as in childcare articles and toys.\nPhthalates are just scratching the surface and only one of many toxic ingredients in our daily regime. Did you know the average woman exposes herself to approximately 512 toxic chemicals in a day?? Don\u2019t count yourself lucky yet boys\u2026the average male uses up to 80 toxic chemicals in his daily self care routine!!!\nSo, how do we protect ourselves, and decrease the toxic level in our bodies therefore decreasing the ageing process?? Well, aside from the obvious clean, healthy dietary protocol, adequate water intake and proper exercise\u2026if you have enough time (& money, as this can be costly), you can make your own organic personal health products at home, there are several recipes to do this available online. For example (some of these recipes contain Petroleum Products, and that\u2019s a no no!) Unfortunately, as well as not always containing safe \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients and being costly to purchase all that is needed, these products often will not last long and are somewhat time consuming as you will find yourself making small batches often. Also, all of us are looking for results driven products. Right?? Products that will make a difference. If we weren\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t be looking at an anti-aging site to begin with\u2026correct??\nThere are European formulated personal care products out there. Check your labels! If it is made in Europe or free of toxins such as Parabens, Mineral Oil, Formaldehyde denoting preseratives, Benzene, Petroleum, Toulene, Phthalates, Dyes, Chemical Fragrances, PABA, PEG compounds, Siloxanes, Triclosan, or SLS (Sodium Laurel Sulphate), it is far safer for use by you and your loved ones\u2026.and will not contain toxins that are actually increasing your ageing process!!\nBuyer beware\u2026.just because it says \u201cOrganic\u201d or \u201cNatural\u201d on the label it does not mean it is 100% organic, natural, or even healthy for you. I have seen many \u201cNatural\u201d health care products that contain SLS and other toxic ingredients.",

I was in three Christmas concerts, voluteered for a fundraiser, made a ton of dog sweaters for an event, competed in a baking contest, made cookbooks for my sisters, had 3 out of town Christmases and hosted two different sets of relatives here. Phew! Luckily my house stayed pretty clean, so a few swiffers to pick up the extra dogs lying around my house and some cleaned bathroom counters and mirrors were all that was needed.\nI don't know about you ladies out there, but my husband is not a very talented wrapper or cook, which means all of that was left to me. I admire you women who have children and have to wrap tons of small presents. The only kids I have to wrap for are the triplets (my husband and his two brothers) and I mostly just stuff all their gifts in one box so it's easy to wrap!\nI have this problem though. You see, my mother-in-law is a super perfect wrapper. Her other sons just dump their presents off at her house to wrap. I save her the trouble and wrap our own, but I have to do a very good job because they will be scrutinized.

Finally a use for my ceramics degree...\nFor my sisters this year I got together with my Grandmothers and collected the family recipes we grew up with and love. I spent hours reading recipes my Great-Grandmothers had hand written, and typed them up with little stories and anecdotes that my Grandmothers added in. I ran out of time and couldn't type everything they sent me. It ended up being 108 pages total. I put it in some nice 3-ring binders so we can add more in the future.

I chose to add very little to mine because I wanted it to have that very thick, almost puree like consistency.\nI think it makes a soup that much more filling and satisfying when it\u2019s really nice and thick.\nAnd filling and satisfying would be the very definition of this luxurious soup.\nBoth times I had it, I could not believe how full I was after having eaten \u201cjust a tiny little bowl of soup\u201d\nWell, after all, there IS half a head of cauliflower, one entire head of garlic and a little bit over half an apple in every bowl.\nYet, this soup contains virtually no fat, is super low in calories, is loaded with proteins and has TONS of flavor!\nThe combination of roasted cauliflower, roasted garlic and apple, topped with a touch of vinegar really is outstanding.\nAnd talk about elegant! Oh, how I love it when my food looks all sophisticated like that.\nOne word of warning though. The addition of Greek yogurt and egg whites makes this soup extremely delicate. You can never allow it to boil after these ingredients have been added, else the yogurt would curdle and the egg whites would scramble.\nNot what I would call very pleasing to the eye, or the palate for that matter.\nSo if you were to reheat it, do so over very low heat, ever so patiently and with plenty of TLC.\nBut chances are, there will be no leftovers for you to reheat, so you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that!\n- 2 whole heads of garlic\n- 1 head cauliflower\n- 1 small onion, chopped\n- 1 Golden Delicious apple, peel on, diced\n- 1 + 1 or 2 cups of water\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00bd tsp black pepper\n- hint freshly grated nutmeg\n- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar\n- 1 cup egg whites\n- 1 cup fat free plain Greek yogurt\n- Balsamic Pearls\n- Spartan Apple, diced\n- Basil leaves\n- Preheat oven to 400F\n- Remove as much peel from the garlic as you possibly can by simply rubbing it with your fingers and cut off the very top to expose a small portion of the cloves. Place each head of garlic on a square of aluminum foil, sprinkle a little bit of salt and pepper and close the foil to seal the garlic in.\n- Cut cauliflower into florets and lay it in a single layer on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n- Place cauliflower and garlic in the oven and roast for 30-35 minutes, until cauliflower is fragrant, tender, and has taken a nice golden coloration. You\u2019ll want to flip the pieces once halfway through cooking.\n- In a large sauce pan, cook onion over medium heat until fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Squeeze the heads of garlic to get the cloves out and add that to the pot, along with apples, cauliflower, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cider vinegar and one cup of water. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 10 minutes.\n- Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes before transferring to the bowl of your food processor.\n- Process on high speed and while the motor is running, add Greek yogurt by the spoonful and slowly pour in egg whites. You want to pour them slowly and in a continuous stream so the eggs don\u2019t cook.\n- Transfer the soup back to the stock pot, add one or two cups of water, depending on desired consistency and bring this up in temperature, almost to a simmer. However, it is very important that you do now allow the soup to boil at this point, again, to avoid cooking the eggs.\n- For a smoother consistency, strain the soup through a fine mesh sieve before returning it to the stockpot.\n- Serve warm and garnish with balsamic pearls, dices of apple and fresh basil leaves, if desired.\nWhat a delightful cup of goodness! I love cauliflower pur\u00e9e and the apple addition here is downright yummy. I did one recently on the savoury side with shiitake and smoked paprika. It\u2019s hard to beat Greek yogurt as a non-meat source of bioavailable protein. Perfect!\np.s. I thought your pretty balsamic pearls was a blackberry at first! Great touch.\nHaha, too funny! I wonder if blackberries and cauliflower would work well together\u2026 maybe in a salad? I might have to give that a try!\nLove the bowls!! Where did you find them .? They are beautiful.

Each couple is assigned one recipe to prepare and bring to the dinner and the host and hostess provide the main course, a side dish and all the wine and beverages.\nAfter the first course, which was a refreshing Spanish almond, cucumber and grape gazpacho, this delightful salad was served. Not too difficult to prepare, it was not only delicious but the baby romaine, or Little Gem lettuce, looked adorable on the plate. The creamy pistachio dressing, toasted pistachios and sliced radishes added even more crunch and was a delightful combination of flavors.\nSo what else have I been doing since my last post? Hosting our three grandsons numerous times for swimming and overnights...\nCelebrating our anniversary at a wonderful seafood restaurant on the lakefront in downtown Milwaukee. It was a lovely summer evening on the patio with a view to the west of the Calatrava-designed Milwaukee Art Museum and, to the east, of the inner Lake Michigan harbor...\nAnd, of course, I've been enjoying my garden and all the sunny yellow blooms this year :)\nBaby Romaine Salad with Creamy Pistachio Dressing\nServes 4\nFor the Vinaigrette:\n3 teaspoons minced shallot\n1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar\n1-1/4 teaspoons salt\n3/4 cup raw, unsalted shelled pistachios (regular salted, shelled pistachios work fine but cut back on additional salt)\n1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n1-1/4 teaspoons lemon juice\n1/3 cup aioli (mix 1/3 cup mayonnaise with 1 minced garlic clove and 1-1/2 tsp lemon juice)\n3 tablespoons pistachio oil (optional)\n1/3 cup cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream\n1-1/2 teaspoons minced tarragon\n3 teaspoons minced chives\n3 teaspoons minced flat-leaf parsley\n3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon sugar\nTo make the vinaigrette:\nPreheat the oven to 325F. Place the shallot in a small mixing bowl, cover with the vinegar. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and set aside to macerate for about 10 minutes.\nSpread the pistachios on a small baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Roughly chop the pistachios and divide them into two batches of 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup. Set aside.\nIn a small mixing bowl, whisk together the macerated shallot and its liquid, the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, the lemon zest and juice, the aioli, the pistachio oil, and the cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream.\nAt this point, the salad can be refrigerated until ready to use.\nBefore serving, add the minced herbs and whisk again. Taste and season with pepper and sugar, if necessary.\nFor the Salad:\n2 large or 4 small heads Little Gem Lettuce (regular romaine would also work using the pale, inner head)\n2 radishes\nFlaky finishing salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nTo make the Salad:\nTrim off the base of each lettuce leaving the head intact. Cut each head of lettuce in half vertically and place in a large bowl of water to clean thoroughly. Drain on paper towels and spin out any remaining water in a salad spinner.\nSlice the radishes thinly and place in a bowl of ice water. Store in refrigerator. Dry well with paper toweling before serving.\nTo serve, stir 1/2 cup of the chopped pistachios into the vinaigrette. Arrange lettuces on plates and spoon the vinaigrette equally over each lettuce half. Top with the radish slices, remaining chopped pistachios. Add a sprinkle of flaky sea salt and some freshly ground pepper and serve.\nAdapted from Taste and Technique by Naomi Pomeroy.\nI!",

    "answer": "To prepare the Baby Romaine Salad with Creamy Pistachio Dressing, first make the vinaigrette by mincing shallot, adding white wine vinegar, salt, and setting it aside. Toast the pistachios in the oven, chop them and divide into two batches. Whisk together the macerated shallot and its liquid, the remaining salt, lemon zest and juice, aioli, pistachio oil, and cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream. Add minced herbs, pepper and sugar to taste. For the salad, clean the lettuce, slice the radishes and store in ice water.

    "context": "Meatloaf and I go back a long way. My mother, of sturdy Midwestern stock, seemed to view meatloaf as a catch-all cloaking device for whatever bits and scraps remained in the refrigerator or pantry at the end of a given week (month? year?). I can remember watching with mounting distaste as carrots, spinach, rhubarb--was that oatmeal?--disappeared into her Pyrex mixing bowl, and wondering why a raw egg needed to be part of this process. Just observing the assembly of my mom's meatloaf had me convinced before my first bite that this was quite likely the most disgusting food ever invented. And then it came out of the oven--a craggy, rectangular meteorite from the part of space where they stare you down with unflinching meat-and-spinach eyes. I may have only been five years old, but I knew I was\nNOT. GOING. TO. EAT. THAT.\nWell, you can imagine what happened next. In the classic parent-child food battle maneuver, I sat at the dinner table and refused to eat a single bite. Mom, not to be outdone in battle strategy, pulled the parent checkmate of you'll-sit-there-until-you-finish-it-even-if-it-takes-all-night! I really thought I could stick to my guns on this one, but around 2 AM (okay, it was probably only about 7:30) I was getting pretty sick of banging my heels on the rattan seat of my chair while my brother played. I grudgingly accepted defeat and picked up a piece of (now cold) brown meteorite and willed myself to eat it. And it was indeed wretched.\nBeing the kind of kid who loved to make lists of favorites and least favorites--favorite color: pink, favorite stuffed animal: Puffalump--I quickly placed meatloaf at the very top of my LFFL, least favorite foods list. (Move over, lima beans.) For the remainder of my years at home, I gave my mom so much grief every time she cooked it that she eventually caved and stopped making it altogether. Still, over the years, meatloaf has remained the unshakeable king of my LFFL. Even as an adult, if forced to eat meatloaf under social duress, I have always made sure to spread it around my plate as much as possible to make it look like I've actually made a dent in the stuff.\nThe problem with meatloaf now that I am an adult, however, is that my husband loves it. So recently, motivated by wifely devotion, I decided to take a chance and try a meatloaf recipe I found in one of my favorite cookbooks, The Cleaner Plate Club, which incidentally focuses on getting your kids to eat healthy foods. How ironic. All the recipes I've tried from this cookbook have been great, so I thought I'd give it a go. Plus, it didn't call for anything revolting, which helped ease my trepidation. In fact, the ingredients actually looked appealing--parmesan cheese, fresh rosemary, garlic, homemade roasted tomatoes. I ended up using tomatoes and rosemary from our garden, some good quality ground beef, and yes, the requisite raw egg. And much to my surprise, the end result was\u2026dare I say\u2026delicious? I could barely believe my tastebuds. This fresh and fragrant comfort food was endangering meatloaf's long-held number one position on my LFFL. I even had seconds.\nIt may sound strange, but I feel like meatloaf is teaching me a lesson. Meatloaf seems to be whispering (with its meat-and-spinach mouth) that things are not always what they seem, that it is possible to change our minds about even the most white-knuckle-gripped opinions. Granted, my cookbook's recipe is drastically different from my mom's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink concoction, but if I can change my mind about meatloaf, what else can I re-think? My attitudes about people, places, things? I don't ever want my opinions to become so calcified that there is no room for change. Because how boring is that? I'd like to think I will carry the meatloaf lesson with me as I go about decision-making and opinion-forming in my daily life.\nThough I do promise I will not be carrying around any actual meatloaf. No matter how good it tastes, that would just be gross.\nBut it you'd been forced to eat honey lentil loaf, it'd be a different story. :) I think money would have to be involved for that to pass my lips again.\nI have six half-sized loaves of this recipe in my freezer:\nI would like to put it on the record that I don't actually LOVE meatloaf. I enjoy meatloaf. It's tasty, but not necessarily beloved.\nThe new recipe, however, is really really delicious. Perhaps as close to beloved meatloaf as ever.",

    "context": "I have been busy working away again this week. (Keeping up with my goals so far.) I started this notebook cover before Christmas. It was going to be a collage but ended up mainly as painting. This is made with paper towels with which I wiped up dye. I glued that down and then added oil paint sticks and then a bit of stamping after that was dry. This is the notebook where I am keeping all my design work for the Traveling Pages. I am currently working on designing for \"Fairy Tales\" for Ann. I have several sketches, now I just have to decide which one to use.\nHere's a close up.\nI embellished my last 'wrinkled' vessel.\nI used a variety of yarns - these are attached at the ends and then wrapped.\nHere's a close up.\nAnd another. I'm thinking of submitting these to the \"500 Felt Objects\" book. What do you think? Good enough to get in? I'm kind of gun shy about entering things but I guess all they can say is \"No\" and there's no entry fee. I have to make sure the photos are the right size.\nHere's the vessel I made today from the same resist that I used for the one above. Here it is after laying out and wetting down. As you can see, I've added the same yarns I used on the one above as inclusions in the felt.\nHere is is drying. It has a sugar bowl in the bottom to keep it in shape. I used a sewn shibori technique to get the ridges in the sides. The threads are still in as it is drying. I'll take them out once it's dry. You can see the threads sticking out at the top.\nHere's another view.\nHere's a close up.\nHere is some of the work I've been doing in my journal. I'm still working through the book \"7 Keys to Great Painting\" by Jane Hofstetter. The page on the right is value shape patterns that she recommends you use as the base of all your paintings. Therefore, you have planned ahead of time where your dark and light values will be. She uses them for all her paintings and has many to choose from to fit to each subject.\nThis is more about value shape patterns. The page on the left shows 6 different ones that always seem to work well. The page on the right shows how you can take a poor sketch and use different techniques to improve it.\nMore value shape patterns. I have really enjoyed this book and will be using her 7 keys to improve my work when I do a 2D piece. I think these will really help with machine embroidery pieces such as landscapes.\nHere's some ideas for future felt pieces. I want to make some shapes based on \"snow ghosts\". We get these on top of the mountain and they are cool shapes.\nMy sketches for possible vessel shapes are on the left. These will all use the same resist but look very different. The questions on the right are from the 7 Keys book. You can click on any of these photos to enlarge them so you can see them better.\nThe other good thing that happened this week was that I sold two of my pieces at the store, Perpetual Poppies and Birch Grove. Woohoo!\n8 comments:\nYou absolutely should submit it - it's fantastic!\nHave a lovely weekend\nCarolyn\nYou've been busy!\nI think you should submit the piece. You never know unless you try.\nBe brave, send off a photo! I'll keep my fingers crossed you get your lovely work accepted.\nThank you for the info as well on the art book, I shall have to look out for it.\nits so good to see your processes. It amaes me how differently people work, how different techniques have evolved along the way.\nI am so happy to have found you on blogspot! I'm a felter and I love your wrinkled vessels!

    "context": "1-Tell the readers a little about yourself.\nI\u2019m never just one thing. Some of my beliefs seem contradictory to people. I have many and disparate interests, and I\u2019ve been known to change my mind occasionally.\nI\u2019m married, my children are grown, and I have lots of grandchildren. I teach natural childbirth classes, cook Real Food, and try to live close to nature. There\u2019s always room for improvement.\n2-As an author, do you take time to read? If so, what do you like to read and who is/are your favorite author/s?\nOh my, yes. I\u2019ve not stopped reading since I learned how. I read all kinds of things (see #1 above), but mostly science fiction, with fantasy a close second. My favorite authors are the ones whose books I read over and over again because their worlds and characters have become a part of me. I will buy their new books without second thought: Julie Czernada, Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, Anne McAffrey, Diana Gabaldon... there are many more, but those are the front runners.\n3-How do you stay motivated when the Muse is uncooperative?\nThe short answer is, I don\u2019t. The only way I keep writing is if I know something is expected by someone. Like this interview. I tend to not put things off if I know I HAVE to get it out the door, but this means that my novels suffer major neglect.\n4-If you could go anywhere in the world on a romantic getaway, what would you do and where would you go?\nSomeplace with a view of the stars. We both love to stargaze, with and without telescopes. One of our favorite memories from our honeymoon was stopping the car along the road between Lahaina and Kihei on Maui, and staring at the Milky Way.\n5-What is the hardest thing for you to write?\nI don\u2019t know. This may sound silly, but I guess it would be anything I didn\u2019t want to be writing.\n6-If you could live the life of one of your characters who would you be?\nThis isn\u2019t easy to answer. If I could choose a setting, I would live in Moon Over Donamorgh - Irish forest, witches, fairies, and people who care for each other. But while I\u2019d like live with those characters, I wouldn\u2019t want to be any of them.\nI think it would fun to be Sandy Tan from Webs, which is the story in the Samhain anthology.

My childhood was spent \u2018living through\u2019 the disease.\nMy mother often quizzed me about breast health and early detection. I accompanied her to too many doctors\u2019 appointments and nursed her as she fought the awful side effects of Chemotherapy over twenty years ago.\nIn the back of my mind, I always knew Cancer was something that might present itself within my body, the only question was when?\nBorn and raised in Chicago, IL; I moved to San Francisco for high school. I graduated from San Diego State University. In my early 20s and 30s I traveled frequently \u2026. living in London as well as Israel. Experiencing life in other countries, made me realize time and again how fortunate I was to have my life.\nI met my husband David on a blind date in November 1999. We knew from the beginning that we had something special. We were married in May 2002. In March 2003, we bought our house. All was going well\u2026 we were living the picture perfect life.\nIn early 2004, we were blessed with the birth of our beautiful daughter, Malia. Because of my strong family history I\u2019d begun having mammograms at the age of 30. Shortly after I stopped breast feeding I went in for a routine mammogram. And there it was \u2013 DCIS \u2013 the cancer had arrived! Because of my prior mammograms the cancer was detected extremely early.\nFrom the beginning I looked at this experience as a journey, an obstacle I had to overcome, but one that would give me opportunities.\nAfter several conversations with my surgeon, we decided I\u2019d have a bi-lateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, a DIEP flap. She thought I was an excellent candidate for the procedure and since I still had some pregnancy weight, I thought what the heck, it will be a great way to get a tummy tuck and boob job!! In reality, my goal was to eliminate any future treatments and experiences with breast cancer.\nThe surgery was 14 hours long, with a painful 10 week recovery. My margins came back clear, and I was told I did not need any additional treatments. No Chemo, No Radiation, No Tamoxifin\u2026 Yippie!!!\nI am a poster child for early detection, and I am thankful every day.\nBut my story does not end there. Fast forward two years, in October 2006 David and I received the news that our 12 week fetus was healthy and viable. After experiencing two miscarriages, we were overjoyed with happiness. Malia was 2.5, and having a second child was a primary goal before, during and after my DCIS diagnosis.\nOne day shortly after getting the \u2018all good\u2019 news, David asked me if I\u2019d felt any changes to my breasts due to the pregnancy. I decided to perform a Breast Self Exam. As I was feeling about and tucked right under my left arm pit, just at the area where my new tissue met my old tissue, was a small, round \u2018thing\u2019.\nTo tell you I panicked is an understatement. Luckily I was able to see our local breast doctor immediately. She performed a biopsy on a Friday morning, and by Monday afternoon I was diagnosed with my second bout of breast cancer in two years. Not a metastasis, but a brand new occurrence and an aggressive one. The tumor was so small, about 8 mm, my doctor couldn\u2019t believe I had found it.\nI often say that David and Ari saved my life. If I wasn\u2019t pregnant David wouldn\u2019t have asked me that question and I wouldn\u2019t have found the lump until much later.\nThe question of \u2018what to do and when\u2019 became critical. The reality was I needed to get the cancer out and start treatments as soon as possible. Unfortunately, (but luckily for us) there are other women who have been through Chemo while pregnant \u2013 I was put in contact with several of them.\nDavid and I had many LONG conversations with these women and through our talks we both felt better about moving forward with keeping the baby and starting treatments.\nSo after many doctors\u2019 visits \u2013 to the oncologist, the ob-gyn, the surgeon, the peri-natal specialist, (and the therapist)\u2026.we decided to have the tumor removed and start A/C at week 22 of gestation.\nYes, I was nervous and yes, I was scared.\nBut, when I think about to that time and the steps we took to make decisions, I remember a conversation with my breast surgeon. She told me the best news I during this diagnosis was being Her2 receptor positive.\nPreferring to look at the silver linings in life\u2026if I had to be diagnosed again, if I had to go through Chemo and Radiation\u2026 then it was because I needed to be a Herceptian recipient. Herceptian is going to ensure I am around to play with my grandchildren.\nFive months after my diagnosis, on my 39th birthday March 22, 2007, our healthy baby boy, Ari Jonathan arrived four weeks early allowing time for me to recover and start my next phase of treatments Taxol/Herceptian and Radiation. He arrived with a full head of hair (more than me!), a good weight and powerful lungs.\nAfter he was born, Ari accompanied me to most of my treatments. Not surprisingly each office staff claimed their share of the responsibility for his miraculous birth. He is a miracle baby.\nToday (January 2012), I have past my 5 year cancer free mark, and have been given a \u2018clean bill of health\u2019. Yet, each day (as I look at my children \u2013 Malia 7.5 and Ari 4.5) is another accomplishment, and another blessing.\nAgain, I am a poster child for early detection and Self Breast Exams. And Yes, I am thankful everyday.\nIn February 2010, I lost my father to COPD and Lung Cancer. I know living through my experience (and laughter about) cancer, chemo and radiation his journey was a little less scary. I think of him every day and know that because of his values, lessons and legacy \u2013 my life will forever be fulfilled.\nI cannot finish this note without mentioning \u2018whom\u2019 that got us through this journey. If it weren\u2019t for the amazing support of an incredible group of family and friends, a network that has surrounded us providing meals, sending prayers, driving me to appointments, babysitting our kids, sending care packages, just in general doing anything we need, above and beyond\u2026 we NEVER would be able to face all this. My only hope is that I can pay forward their generosity and someday make the life of someone else in need as meaningful as they have made mine.",

Verdict gives other\nvictims the courage to come forward\nBY DAVID CLOHESSY\nKnight Ridder Newspapers\nFebruary 13, 2005\n(KRT) - Thirty minutes after a Massachusetts jury found ex-priest Paul\nShanley guilty of molesting a boy, I got a call from a man who was also\nabused by a priest. ``I've never told anyone except my wife,'' he said.\n``That verdict gave me the strength to finally tell someone else.''\nTo me, that proved that the Shanley verdict was indeed a victory for\nus all. Anything that makes it even slightly less difficult for wounded\nabuse survivors to come forward is progress.\nBecause of archaic and rigid statutes of limitations, very few abusive\nclergy ever see the inside of a courtroom. Because of timid prosecutors\nand excessive deference, virtually no complicit church officials have.\nSo the mere fact that Shanley faced criminal charges at all was, in itself,\nat least a partial victory for the tens of thousands of clergy molestation\nvictims, many of whom continue to suffer in shame, silence, and self-blame\neven now.\nThe fact that a jury unanimously declared Shanley guilty is even more\nsignificant. Not too many years ago, it was unthinkable that average citizens\ncould convict a cleric of such horrific crimes.\nMost clergy molestation victims disclose their private horror to no one\nbut a spouse, sibling or dear friend.\nMost never pursue criminal or civil charges. Most just try to muddle\nalong, cope with their pain, and try to forget (often using addictions\nlike booze, drugs, sex or work). And those who do speak up most often\nsimply want some acknowledgement that yes, a terrible crime (usually avoidable,\nhad church authorities acted sooner) was committed against them.\nIt's rare to get that kind of admission from a bishop, or even a simple\n``I'm sorry for what you endured and for how you're still suffering.''\nSo some of us take legal action. For many, that can ultimately be very\nhealing.\nThis is not to minimize the public safety benefit of putting Shanley\nbehind bars or on probation. Despite his age, he must be considered a\nthreat. The mere passage of time doesn't magically cure a compulsive predator.\nBut to the wounded and often fragile psyches of people like me, once trusting\nbut severely violated Catholics, the Shanley verdict is a ray of hope.\nIt reminds us that when victims stay silent, nothing changes, but when\nvictims come forward, sometimes justice is possible and more pain is prevented.\nIt reminds us that when it's time to report our victimization, it's better\nto go to our flawed but time-tested, open, impartial American justice\nsystem, rather to a new, untested, secretive and biased internal church\nprocess.\nOn the down side, Shanley's depravity has deflected attention away from\neven greater depravity: the inexcusable inaction by church officials who\nknew about or suspected sex crimes but did nothing to protect innocent\nkids and vulnerable adults. That's where our attention should be focused.\nShanley will never be a priest again. But four or five of the clerics\nwho shielded him and rebuffed his victims still are. In fact, they're\nnow bishops. There will be no real ``victory'' for men and women who have\nbeen raped by priests and ignored by bishops until these men - top church\nofficials - are no longer in positions where they can put vulnerable parishioners\nat risk.\n-- ---\nABOUT THE WRITER\nDavid Clohessy of St. Louis is the national director of the Survivors\nNetwork of those Abused by Priests. He and his brothers were molested\nby a mid-Missouri priest in the 1960s and 1970s. Clohessy can be reached\nthrough the group's Web site: SNAPnetwork.org. He wrote this for the Duluth\n(Minn.) News Tribune.\n---\n\u00a9 2005, Duluth News Tribune (Duluth, Minn.).",

How do we know that recent decisions represent good judgment? Until consensus on measuring the quality of judgments is achieved, this question cannot be answered.\n6. How much time is required for decisions to be proven wise or not? See the response to question 5..\nAt the end of the day experience is the result of poor judgement and the only way to improve judgement is to make mistakes. So the leader's main role is to control the environment where subordinates can learn to limit the damage..\nA bit of folk wisdom poses a similar \"which is better\" question: Which would you rather be--young or old?\nA young person has made fewer mistakes, but many more lie in the future; an old person has made many more mistakes, but has few in the future.....\nThen, the \"judgment call\" can be made with possibly more opportunity for success than failure.\nMr. Wilde makes a good point.

In fact, both are insufficient and incomplete without each other..\ngrey zone where the path is barely visible and risks rise like flowers in April. The bottom line: are your leaders willing to allow you to make judgement calls without their permission - or even their knowledge?!\nEveryone needs experience to be able to develop or hone good judgment. Nevertheless, experience from bad judgment is no guarantee that anyone will learn from their experiences and develop good judgment....\nOne final comment - that quotation \"Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from poor judgment\" cited by many but attributed to various sources is also sourced to the humorist Will Rodgers. Does anyone have a definitive source for this one?.\nAccording to me, it's a 80-20 Principal.\nIn a rapidly changing environment the possible analogies diminuish; judgment will have to rely more and more on the values we receaved from our mother and on our willingness to make a difference..\nExperience alone isn't enough, it mush be coupled by a search for honesty and a willingness to adjust that makes good judgment possible.\nGo Obama.\nClearly, Wisdom over Experience anyday.\nConcurring with those who stated that one's values are the underpinning of the judgments, one must also conclude that if we judge those judgements as sound, no doubt our values match their's.\nAnd to Sam Friend .. I concur..\nI define judgement as the ability to make the right choices given the circumstances at the time of the event. We often do not have all the information needed and that makes judgement and experience hard to separate.

Order your Wuthering Heights: Catherine - Character Analysis paper at affordable prices with livepaperhelp.com!\nCatherines Character\nIn the beginning Catherine is introduced to us as high spirited, kind to Heathcliff, and a free spirit. These qualities originally made me like her and her love for Heathcliff. However her character drastically changes throughout the story. When she hurts her leg and is forced to say at the neighboring house, Thrushcross Grange with the Lintons she returns to Wuthering Heights as a dignified, well dressed lady. She was easily swayed to the superior life style of the Lintons, and began to look down upon her old friend and soulmate Heathcliff. She even laughs at Heathcliffs rough and dirty appearance and says! We the reader, are left surprised and cheated with this reversal of Catherine. She becomes more and more selfish by the minute and trys to change Heathcliff, and begins to feel that he is infact beneath her. Which is one of the main reasons she starts to look at Edgar Linton in a new light. For he is a gentleman, refined, handsome and rich. Her feelings for Edgar and Heathcliff become increasingly apparent. However, she claims to be in love with Heathcliff and says that they have the same souls My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff. Although she is well aware that her love for Heathcliff is bound to change as time passes, she still is obsessed by her love for Heathcliff she confirms it in the above quotation and by saying that she will never, ever be separated from him. Why does she not marry him then? Well, she has another obsession too; she does not want to degrade herself by marrying him. Instead she thinks that by marrying Linton she can and Heathcliff can rise socially. So she goes ahead and accepts Edgars proposal. This quick decision is baffling and hurtful. We can see she is marrying Edgar for all the wrong reasons she even confides to Nelly that he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighborhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband. So when push comes to shrove, she throws away love for he own selfish wants and materialistic motives. Catherine wanted Edgar for his life and riches and Heathcliff for his soul. She didnt want to choose between the two of them, and therefore she never really did. She toyed with both of them by marrying Edgar while still loving Heathcliff. Thus, she caused pain for Heathcliff and Edgar, by causing Edgar to feel jealous and Heathcliff wanting revenge. Catherines passion for Heathcliff ruined the lives of so many people at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. The whole story revolved around the passion that Catherine and Heathcliff felt for each other. Edgar, on the other hand, felt a more reasonable love for Catherine. Catherine was devoted to Edgar, yet was in love with Heathcliff! Later in the story when she seems to be suffering with the decisions she has made, I cant say I feel bad for her, because she made those bad choices and now she must live with them. Her relationships were based on impulse and passion, she never thought them out or used her head. I cant help but think of her as a spoiled child who likes to be in the center of attention, by stringing along both men, and wanting to be the most powerful woman of land.\nPlease note that this sample paper on Wuthering Heights: Catherine - Character Analysis is for your review only.

E.T.\u2019s new owners sued the Millers for breaching the noncompete by providing assistance to Kuhns as he learned the Petroleum Solutions business.

When E.T. severed its relationship with Petroleum Solutions in 2012, Doug told Kuhns that the noncompetition agreement prevented further help and ceased assisting him.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the contract was not overbroad, but that the Millers did not breach it. A company\u2019s distributor is not its competitor, so the Millers\u2019 assistance to Kuhns in 2012 was \"fair game.\" The contract, read reasonably, did not require Doug to break his preexisting lease with Kuhns.

Ratajczak\nFrom 2006-2012 Packerland deceived at least one of its customers about the protein content of its Whey Protein Concentrate. Land O\u2019Lakes purchased Packerland\u2019s protein concentrate for use in making foods for calves and other young animals. Buyers infer protein levels from measuring nitrogen: a seller can add another nitrogen-rich substance to produce higher scores. The Ratajczaks, who owned Packerland, started adding urea to its protein concentrate. in 2006. Land O\u2019Lakes suspected that the concentrate was high in nonprotein nitrogen but could not learn why; the Ratajczaks made excuses that Land O\u2019Lakes accepted. The Ratajczaks sold Packerland in 2012. The new owner kept them as employees; they kept adding urea until the buyer learned what the truth. The Ratajczaks lost their jobs and settled for about $10 million before the buyer filed a complaint. Land O\u2019Lakes stopped buying Packerland\u2019s product and asserted claims of breach of contract, fraud, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Packerland\u2019s insurers refused to defend or indemnify it or the Ratajczaks; the Ratajczaks\u2019 personal insurer refused to indemnify them for their settlement with Packerland\u2019s buyer. The district court dismissed Land O\u2019Lakes\u2019s suit and ruled in favor of the insurers. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, rejecting Land O\u2019Lakes\u2019 claim to treble damages under RICO and state-law and the Ratajczaks\u2019 claims that Packerland\u2019s insurers and their own insurers had to defend and indemnify them.

Volvo Trucks North America\nIn 2010, Mohr and Volvo entered into a heavy truck dealership agreement. In 2012, Volvo sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to terminate Mohr\u2019s dealership because Mohr had misrepresented that it would build a new long\u2010term facility for the dealership. Mohr complained that Volvo had violated Indiana\u2019s Franchise Disclosure and Deceptive Franchise Practices Acts by promising to award Mohr a Mack Truck dealership franchise, which would have justified Mohr\u2019s investment in the new facility. Volvo gave the Mack franchise to another company. Mohr also accused Volvo of providing more favorable concessions on truck pricing to other franchise dealerships through its Retail Sales Assistance program. The district court granted summary judgment, holding that the integration clause in the dealer agreement barred the new\u2010facility claim and the Mack franchise claim. Following a trial on the unfair discrimination claim, a jury awarded Mohr $6.5 million. The Seventh Circuit reversed the award for the unfair discrimination claim and affirmed the summary judgment rulings. The court stated that these were sophisticated parties, bound by the integration clause and that Mohr did not establish unfair discrimination with respect to price concessions.

    "context": "\"A Feast for Crows\" is the only book in aSoIaF series that I have read only once, and this was five years or so ago. This means I forgot much of it - I was surprised how much exactly. I remembered that was Jaime and Cersei in there, Brianne and Arya, of course. But I completely forgot about Greyjoys, Sam, Martells, Sansa... I also knew the plot in general, but most of details were gone from my memory. All in all, this was almost like reading the book for the first time.\nOne thing did remain in my mind strongly - I didn't like \"A Feast for Crows\" much the first time I've read it. And judging by reviews and comments I read at that time, a lot of people shared this opinion. Most of everybody's favorite characters were missing (Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys), and majority of readers didn't like Brienne's part. Arya's part was great, but it was too short.\nAlthough these objections mostly still stand, I like this book much more the second time. Brienne's POV is still not great as others, but it serves to depict how desperate situation in Seven Kingdoms has become. This is continuation from \"A Storm of Swords\" - Seven Kingdoms has definitely become a place where no one is safe and life is hard. And considering the amount of food and prospect of another harvest, things will get even nastier. Also, Podric is one of my favorite minor characters.\nJaime's and Cersei's part are great - well, greatly written at least. It is interesting how they have switched roles comparing to \"A Game of Thrones\". At that time Jaime was a brutal and dishonorable bully, the notorious Kingslayer. And Cersie, well, she wasn't likable for sure, but she was strong, fierce and experienced in game of thrones. And now, Jaime has become almost a new person, trying to improve himself and find some honor in this brutal world. While Cersei, she has proven not so experienced, smart and definitely not wise - a more pitiful stream of bad decision and stupidly chose advisers has not be see in a long while.\nArya's POV... There is not much to say about it except that is great - everybody like an apprentice story!\nAbout the rest of POVs, Sansa, Sam, Greyjoys, they are nicely written, but forgettable. Even though only a week passed since I read it, I can't recall much details. There was some good parts, but must of them were only necessary, and not great.\nOne part is important, and I completely forgot about it until this reread: the prophecy. Until now, aSoIaF was unusual epic fantasy book because it lacked any BIG plot or theme behind everything, a purpose. We were thrown into this superbly developed setting, with life-like and interesting characters, but we just followed what happened ad-hoc. The prophecy that Aemon gives in one of Sam's characters is probably the most important part of the series so far - it gives meaning to past books and gives an idea what must happened later.\nFor conclusion, even though \"A Feast for Crows\" is not a greatest book in series, it is still very good and very important part of it. If \"A Dance with Dragons\" proves a good twin of it, I will be happy to say that aSoIaF stays at great, April 30, 2012\nASoIaF reread: \"A Feast for Crows\"\nLabels: ASoIaF, best books, book, complex, epic, fantasy, George R.

    "context": "How the Netflix Split Affects Consumers\nEarlier this week, Netflix announced plans to split its disc and streaming operations into completely separate services, renaming its disc service to Qwikster. This follows a separation (and overall increase) in subscriber fees that went into effect earlier this month. While we have plenty of thoughts and opinions about this move, we\u2019ll leave it to the tech press, the markets, and the blogosphere to analyze this baffling move. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on how this change will likely affect the services that Netflix customers are used to. Of course, we won\u2019t know the specifics until it actually happens, but this will give you an idea of the changes you can expect.\nStreaming Customers\nIf you subscribe to the Unlimited Streaming plan with no DVDs, little will change for you. The streaming service will continue to carry the Netflix name, which is no surprise since the Netflix brand is now plastered on hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014of consumer devices.\nDVD Customers\nDVD subscription customers who do not also have streaming will move completely to the new Qwikster service.\nYou\u2019ll go to a new web site, qwikster.com. Hopefully, Netflix will move its DVD customers\u2019 accounts to the new service seamlessly, though they may require an explicit confirmation to transfer your account information.\nFor a premium fee, you\u2019ll also be able to rent games from Qwikster. They\u2019ll be sent to you through the mail just like DVDs and Blu-ray discs.\nThere\u2019s a distinct possibility that third-party apps allowing you to see or manage your Netflix DVD Queue will cease to function properly.\nStreaming + DVD Customers\n12 million people\u2014the largest share of Netflix customers\u2014subscribe to both unlimited streaming and DVDs by mail. These customers will be most impacted by the recently announced service changes. They\u2019ll likely experience the same changes as the DVD customers discussed above, but they also stand to lose the most in terms of service benefits.\nNetflix has been slowly whittling away at the features previously available to customers of both services. There was a time when titles in your DVD Queue showed up automatically in your Instant Queue. Not anymore. And you can no longer manage your DVD Queue from the consumer devices and apps that enable home or mobile streaming.\nWhat other benefits will Streaming + DVD customers lose?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a title on Netflix now, you don\u2019t have to care about whether it\u2019s in the disc library or the streaming library\u2014you don\u2019t have to think about it. You just search once, and it will show up if it\u2019s in either. With this split, you\u2019ll have to go to Netflix to see if a title\u2019s available for streaming and to Qwikster to see if that same title is available on disc. If it\u2019s not available on one service, you\u2019ll have to go look for it on the other.\nWhen you find a title on Netflix now, you can add it to your DVD Queue or (if it\u2019s available for streaming) to your Instant Queue. You can also see if it\u2019s in either queue and play it on the spot if it\u2019s part of the streaming library. All this can be accomplished from the information page for any title. In the new model, you\u2019ll only be able to add DVDs to your queue on Qwikster and play or add streaming titles to your Instant Queue on Netflix. Neither service will have access to the other service\u2019s library or queues.\nThe Netflix DVD Queue lets you know which of the titles in your queue are also available for streaming, and you can play any of them directly from your queue. The new services will likely not let you cross-reference or compare your queues in any way.\nRecommendations will be specific to the ratings you\u2019ve provided in each service, since the rating and recommendation engines will likely be unique to both. For example, if you tend to not rate streaming titles after watching, but you do rate discs when you return them, your recommendations for streaming may not reflect your actual viewing interests.\nAnd in Media Center\u2026\nAt the Digital Media Zone, we recommend Windows Media Center\u2019s Netflix plug-in as one of the best Netflix implementations, and while it is primarily focused on streaming activities, it still offers some visibility into the DVD and Blu-ray libraries and your DVD queue. It\u2019s likely that after the Netflix/Qwikster split occurs, these features will go away\u2014specifically (a) browsing your DVD queue for titles that are available for streaming and (b) searching for titles regardless of whether they\u2019re only available for streaming or on disc.\nAnd of course we\u2019d hope that the transition won\u2019t cause any loss of service in these applications when the split occurs, but at this point, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what\u2019s going to happen.\nPingback: Entertainment 2.0 #146 : Listener Q&A | The Digital Media Zone()\nPingback: Microsoft Should Cut Windows Media Center from Windows 8 | The Digital Media Zone()",

    "context": "A couple of weeks ago I participated in a 48-hour game jam hosted by PlayFab here in Seattle, with fellow procedural planet veteran Alex Peterson, my good friend and composerLeo Langinger, and the fortunate last minute addition of artistBrent Rawls.\nWe were both surprised and excited to have won this game jam, especially given the number and quality of competing entries.\nOur entry, the somewhat awkwardly-named Mad-scien-tile-ology, is a Unity-powered take on the classical 'match-3' game (a la Bejeweled or Candy Crush), with the addition of an all-consuming biological 'creep', which consumes the game board as the player attempts to match tiles in order to slow its inexorable progress:\nWhat went right\n- Separation of responsibilities\nWe had what I can only describe as an optimal team composition for such a short development cycle. Leo was able to focus on composing the music with a little sound design on the side, while Brent concentrated on the artwork, Alex handled all of the UI programming, and I wrote the gameplay logic.\n- Time management\nWe hit the ground running, with an initial match-3 prototype playable early Saturday morning. Thereafter we went into planning mode, and white boarded the roadmap and scheduled checkpoints throughout the day for each deliverable and each integration point for assets. While the estimates weren't perfect, and we missed on a solid handful of items, the organisation helped us to hit 90% of what we set out to do, and still get 2 relatively decent nights of sleep during the competition.\n- Building on Unity\nAlex and I have both played around with Unity in the past, but neither of us had never shipped a full game thereon. Unity represented a fantastic time savings over building a game from scratch, and the asset pipeline alone saved us hours in wiring up the animations and audio.\n- Having an artist, and an unusual artstyle\nWe hit on the idea of stop-motion papercraft before finding Brent, but honestly were it not for his efforts it would have been a disaster. Brent ran with the idea and produced visuals which are striking and unusual. The real-world textures of the paper, the bold colour palette and the stop-motion animations really help the game stand out from other games of this type.\n- Having a composer, and an original score\nIt's easy to underestimate the impact of music on a video game, and as one of the only teams with a professional composer, I think we had an advantage out of the gate. Leo composed original scores for the title screen, gameplay loop, and victory/loss conditions. The upbeat and detailed music really helps sell the 'mad science' theme, and between composing he was able to produce a full range of foley effects for gameplay events that really help to sell the action on screen.\n- Playtesting, playtesting, playtesting\nWe had a playable (if minimal) match-3 game from mid Saturday morning, and that allowed us to play test each new element as we added it. This can be a double-edged sword - when short on time, you can find yourself playing the game instead of implementing features, but it did give us a good idea of what did and didn't work in the context of the game, and allowed us to fit at least some balance tweaks into the time available.\nThe scrumboard\nWhat didn't go so well\n- Version control + Unity = not so good\nWe are used to working with a variety of distributed version control systems, so at the start of the competition we threw everything into a git repository and went to town. Unfortunately, we quickly learned that Unity isn't terribly well suited to git. While all the source files and assets are handled just fine, a great deal of the configuration and logical wiring is contained in the single main.scene file, and being a binary file, git only sees it as an opaque blob. After a couple of merges that resulted in having to rewire assets by hand, we had to fall back to editing separate scene files and copy/pasting to the main scene file before we merged.\n- Time is the enemy\n48-hours is not a long time, and irrespective of our planning, time grew increasingly tight as the competition progressed. While we were able to finish the game to a point we were fairly happy with, a number of features fell to the wayside, most notably highscores. We had intended to implement online leaderboards using our host PlayFab's SDK, but that work had to be deprioritised to make time to fix critical gameplay bugs, and eventually we ran out of time.\n- Last-minute changes are not your friend\nThis one largely follows from the last two points, but Alex and I both tweaked different elements right before we packaged the game for judging, and somewhere in our merge we managed to lose the explosion effect for the player's super-meter, as well as drastically increasing the pace and difficulty of the game in the final build. Neither change badly affected our ability to demonstrate the game, but it's a lesson learned to put the pencils down and focus on testing in the final hours.\n- Always be prepared to talk\nWinning the contest came out of left field, and the surprise coupled with a general lack of sleep had us roughly ad libbing our acceptance, and the subsequent quotes for the organiser's press release. While one wouldn't assume to win any competition, it turns out to be worth putting a few minutes of thought into what you would say if you do. Even a couple of sentences helps smooth over that deer-in-the-headlights moment.\nVideo game art 101\nWhat's next?\nWe're working on getting some of the more egregious bugs fixed, but if you're of a mind to see how it is all put together, the source code and unity project is available over on GitLab. I don't have binaries available for download yet, but we'll try and make it available in a playable form when we have a few more of the kinks worked out.\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to PlayFab, for hosting (and catering!) a fantastic game jam, and our fellow competitors, who build some truly amazing games. Here's looking forward to next time.\nJam attendees checking out our game after the competition\n- Read more...\n- 378 views",

Being a better employee will help us improve the quality of our work, drive our careers and gain us recognition.\nHere are some things to consider when striving to be a better employee:\nStrengths, weaknesses and blind spots\nMost of us will know what our strengths and weaknesses are - we endeavour to maximise our strengths by building on them and minimise our weaknesses by mitigating or avoiding them.\nWhat about those strengths and weaknesses that you don\u2019t know about? Has anyone ever praised you for doing something well that you weren\u2019t aware you did well?\nJenny: Fred, I just wanted to let you know that I thought you did a fantastic job handling that query.\nFred: Really? I just do what I normally do. I didn\u2019t realise I did anything special.\nOr,\nJenny: Fred, do you realise that your body language was very negative when you were receiving that feedback?\nFred: Was it? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realise I was doing anything wrong? What was I doing?\nNot knowing your blind spots can be the Achilles heel of a career plan. It\u2019s hard enough to minimise a weakness when you know about it, but when you don\u2019t know about it then it becomes a negative force field that you can feel but can\u2019t see.\nThe most effective way to discover your strengths, weaknesses and blind spots is to seek quality feedback from significant people in the workplace. Whenever you perform an important task or make a key decision gather honest and open feedback on how you did.\nDoing this consistently will show you where your strengths are and what is holding you back.\nHow do I prefer to work?\nWe each have different preferences for how we like to work. For example, some people like to be left alone to focus on a task, whereas other people prefer to be around others. How you prefer to work is unique to you. It is a combination of many factors, such as personality, experience and attributes.\nTo capitalise on your strengths, work to your preferences. If you prefer to work with others, volunteer for group and project work and try to avoid solo tasks. If you prefer to read rather than listen then make notes of conversations and meetings so you can capture ideas in a manner that utilises your strengths.\nWorking to your preferences amplifies your output and makes you more productive and results in you being a more valuable employee.\nHow do others prefer to work?\nJust as we have a unique approach to work, so do the people we work with.\nTo be a better employee you need to work well with others. Accept that others, like you, are diverse in their approach. But instead of focussing on the differences, focus your energy on finding commonality. What preferences do you share with your colleague? How can you use these common preferences to build on the diversity?\nPaul Allen, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, in his autobiography, describes the relationship between himself and Bill Gates as uniquely dynamic. Here were two very different personalities joined by a common vision and passion for computer programming. Steve Wozniak describes a similar relation with the late Steve Jobs.\nHow do I learn?\nRichard Branson left school at 16. A dyslexic, his performance at school was poor. In fact, on leaving school, his school headmaster predicted that he would either end up in prison, or be a millionaire. Fortunately for Branson, and the world, he discovered his ability to learn was not through books and school, but through others.\nThe composer, Ludwig Von Beethoven, was a prolific writer. He compiled numerous sketchbooks, yet he claimed that he never read them when composing music. He claimed that if he didn\u2019t write it down immediately, then he would forget his thoughts. By writing it down he would learn it and never have to look it up again.\nIdentify how you learn best. Do you learn from others? Do you learn from instructions and books? Do you learn through self-discovery? Again, work to your strengths; \u201cIn the past, when have I learnt the most, when have I learnt the least?\u201d\nDo I know what\u2019s expected of me?\nSuccessful employees have a strong relationship with their manager or supervisor. Questions such as what are my strengths, weaknesses and blind spots, how do I prefer to work, how do others prefer to work, and how do I learn are all in the context of continually improving my ability to meet and exceed my employer\u2019s expectations.\nTo be able to successfully meet and exceed your employer\u2019s expectations, ensure you sit down and take the time to ask them to clarify your goals and objectives. Make sure you that your goals and objectives align to theirs and you understand the context of those goals.\nClarifying expectations about goals and objectives can avoid misunderstandings, wasting time and effort on conflicting priorities, and builds trust and confidence amongst employers and employees.",

In 2015, BCG estimates about $11.0B in spending is for 1.2 million industrial robots, of which 40% (~ $4.4B) are used in automobile factories.\nHowever, robots are moving from manufacturing cars to driving them (think Google). The rest of the industrial segment ($6.6B) and the commercial segment (at $5.9 billion) include a wide range of new applications. Robots are moving into medical, surgical, agricultural, construction, e-commerce fulfillment, and material handling applications.\nTo profit from the robotic megatrend, BCG encourages managers and executives to identify:\n1) Areas of operations with high labor costs \u2013 where robot can produce cost savings\n2) Tasks that people can\u2019t, won\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t do \u2013 that may lead to injury\n3) Human skill gaps \u2013 such as real-time analysis, super speed or strength\n4) Mission-critical applications \u2013 that demand exceptional precision, flexibility, or speed\n5) High complexity \u2013 of changing supply chains with vast supplier networks\nThe good news is, Universal Robotics sells the \u201cbrain\u201d for robots, with its product called Neocortex, which allows flexible human-like behavior to solve these problems.

That\u2019s in the boys\u2019 category. In the young ladies\u2019 category, it\u2019s 17 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you add in track and lacrosse, the totals increase to 40 percent for boys and 37 percent for girls. I\u2019m not sure about the statistics for pickleball, but I do know it\u2019s a fun game.\u201d\nChris Nichols, who also serves on the board of the Henlopen Soccer Club said the complex\u2019s impact would be felt far beyond the time spent on the field. He noted that he and his wife \u2014 both Sussex County natives \u2014 returned to the area after college to start their business.\n\u201cOne of the things we struggle with is attracting and keeping professional folks. Believe it or not, the complex will help us all accomplish that, because in order to live here, you have to see yourself here \u2014 not see ourselves traveling to Salisbury, or see us traveling to Milford, or to Frederica \u2014 but being Sussex Countians, living in this county where we want to play and raise our children,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you, please: help us let the kids and the families see themselves in Sussex County. Someone has to work at the hospital, someone has to build the houses, someone has to fix the HVAC. Telling them, \u2018Do that, and take your kids somewhere else for the weekend\u2019 is not the Sussex County I want to be in. Your sign says you\u2019re my business partner. I\u2019m asking my business partner to approve the complex.\u201d\nKathy Casey, president of the First State Pickleball Club, told the council that, presently, the club has 424 members. She also noted that senior citizens are a significant portion of Sussex County residents.\n\u201cI know having an active healthy lifestyle is critical in this population, because we probably represent the biggest chance of disease coming your way. The healthier you keep us, the happier you\u2019ll be,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat I see, and why this project is so near and dear to me, is I get to see the joy that is created as a result of having public recreation, where anyone \u2014 regardless is socioeconomic status \u2014 has the opportunity to go out and play.\u201d\nMillsboro resident Marion Lisehora said she picked up pickleball six years ago and has been playing the sport every day since.\n\u201cAt 86, I am still promoting sports for seniors in Sussex County and the Sussex sports complex that is proposed for pickleball, along with all the field sports, is really something I\u2019m promoting,\u201d she said. \u201cSeniors need something active to do. We are lacking in places to play. Please support another place for us to play where people my age and the younger ones\u2026\u201d\nSusan Brooker, who serves on the board of the Delaware Senior Olympics, as well as a USA Pickleball Association ambassador, brought pickleball equipment for the council to check out.\n\u201cThe money will come back to you,\u201d she asserted. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just going to help out seniors.\u201d\nSteve Burke, who serves on the board of the Henlopen Soccer Club and the board of the Sussex Sports Center Foundation, and serves on the Sussex Academy School Board, said the complex would be a great asset to kids throughout the county.\nBurke said the club, which was founded in 1996, has 1,300 players, with about 2,500 parents supporting the organization.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t turn away any children from playing the sport of soccer. We believe it develops our players, adds to their quality of life and develops them into meaningful adults.\u201d\nHaving lost its home about a year ago, the club has had to divide up and play at various locations, which he said makes it difficult logistically, but has also raised injury concerns, as not all areas upon which they now play are ideal.\nHe noted that the board of the Henlopen Soccer Club has decided to unanimously support the complex, and to arrange its fee structure, based on its current numbers, to contribute up to $50,000 per year of ongoing support for the complex.\n\u201cWe understand this is a difficult position. We understand the investment is tough for you to justify, but we ask you help us support the position and help us financially support the infrastructure that is needed for the complex.\u201d\nCouncilman Rob Arlett asked where in the process the County is, in terms of discussing whether or not to contribute financial support to the project.\nCounty Administrator Todd Lawson said the County would be accepting comments regarding the complex through the month of October.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no hard deadline, but I do think they do want a decision,\u201d he said.\nArlett said he has more questions and would like the issue placed back on the council agenda.\nCouncilman George Cole asked if the item needed to be placed on the agenda or if it could be a discussion in an executive session.\nCounty Solicitor J. Everett Moore Jr. said the discussion would have to be conducted in a public forum.\nThe council agreed to place the sports complex on a future agenda for discussion.\nThose who wish to email comments may do so online at or by mailing comments to Sussex County Council, P.O.

He became the Bishop of Myitkyina, Burma, in the northern region of the country, in the region of the Kachin ethnic minority.\nThroughout his career, Bishop Howe worked to grow and develop the Catholic community in Burma, especially among the Kachins. In 1962, the Burmese military took over the country under the leadership of General Ne Win, and in 1974 the country officially became a one-party dictatorship.\nThe regime was extremely suspicious of foreigners and any outside influence. The Burmese government began to intimidate and try to expel foreign missionaries, including by passing a law that any missionary who left Burma would not be able to return.\nBishop Howe realized that soon the Columban presence in Burma would end. One of the many Burmese clergy that Bishop Howe has mentored was Father Paul Zinghtung Grawng, an ethnic Kachin who was ordained priest in March 1965.\nBishop Howe sponsored the consecration of Father Grawng as Bishop of Myitkyina. He handed over control of the Diocese of Myitkyina in early 1977 and then left his beloved Burma later that year.\nBishop Grawng later became Archbishop of Mandalay, Burma in 2003 and retired in 2014. Bishop Howe\u2019s selfless act was a superb example of the Columban tradition of developing indigenous clergy in the mission countries.",

    "context": "Here are 6 easy Halloween related toddler activities we have done this month.\n1. Pumpkin decorating with stickers: Our 2 year old is in love with Toy Story these days and we have mountains of stickers in our collection. This was a quick, fun, and CLEAN activity we did together while Littlest Curls was taking an afternoon nap. Peeling and placing the smaller stickers is great for developing fine motor skills. She had fun and was very proud of the Toy Story Pumpkin she decorated herself.\n2. Ghost Feet: I have to admit that I have an obsession with baby feet. For that reason, we have been doing hand and foot prints with the girls on every occasion I can think of (holidays, 3 months 6 months 9 months 1 year, Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s day, etc). This is a fun way to gauge growth too. I\u2019m also obsessed with comparing footprints haha, feel free to judge at anytime ;). Here is *my super secret simple trick for getting almost perfect prints each time* \u2026\u2026\u2026 Paint your kiddos\u2019 hand/foot with the paint using a sponge brush or large paint brush. I used to just pour the paint on a plate and dip my kid\u2019s hand/foot in it and go straight to the paper. This method is a no no because the paint will be uneven in some areas and you won\u2019t get a clean print. Having a non-squirmy kiddo that is willing to have their body painted is always a plus too.\n3. Spider handprint Art: This is fun to add on the wall next to your painted ghost footprints. They are fairly easy to create because it\u2019s all about hand placement. In our project, I put the girls\u2019 hands closer to the corner of the sheet of paper so that I could add a spider web with crayon after the paint dried. If you are feeling more artsy feel free to paint a spider web as a background. You could also make more than one spider on the page if you wanted. Maybe one on a web and one hanging from a string? Get creative with white yarn too!\n4. Pumpkin \u2018Fist\u2019 Patch: If you aren\u2019t sick of paint yet \ud83d\ude09 Give this one a shot! This turns out pretty neat if you have toddler that is willing to make a fist (and keep a fist) to stamp in paint. You just pour paint on a plate and use their hand as stamp. I didn\u2019t use my *super secret* paint on the hand method with this one. We also made pumpkin stems and grass with finger prints. Name it \u201cYour name here\u2019s Pumpkin Patch\u201d and call it art!\n5. Scrap Fabric Spider: I am a fabric hoarder by nature so this was an easy one for us to whip up quickly. To start I had Blondie pick the color construction paper she wanted and then I drew a large circle on it. The circle with be where the child glues down pieces of fabric to make up the body (or cephalothorax and abdomen) of the spider. For the gluing I smudged it around in sections and she placed the fabric in the glue spots. Next, I cut thin strips of another pattern fabric to make up the legs. Did you know spiders have 8 legs and insects have 6? See and you thought you weren\u2019t going to learn anything by reading blogs all day \ud83d\ude09 Once the legs are on, various eyes can be added. I let her choose the buttons and the number of eyes she wanted her spider to have. Have fun with this one!\n6. Cotton Ball Ghost: This is a lot like the fabric spider except the material used is cotton balls. You can get creative with these and use white tissue paper, torn up coffee filters, or anything laying around your house that is white and will stay glued down. Just a simple ghost shape is drawn on the colored paper of choice and glue in sections for your kiddo to place their cotton ball. Add a spooky, happy, or silly face and you have instant ghost decor!\n",

    "context": "Since I've been posting about my experiences with self-publishing, I've kept it real and posted about almost everything I can think of.\nSo I decided to mention this about Jonah Sweet of Delancey Street before it goes live to avoid any possible confusion...which I really don't think will happen. It's not the first time an author or a publisher made a change like this and it won't be the last.\nIt was a publisher who once told me that people do, indeed, judge books by their covers. And I've learned from experience how true that is. Over the years I've been happy for the most part with almost every book cover I've had. My all time favorite cover to date is Chase of a Lifetime...but that could be because that was my first self-published book and I'm very partial to it. With my other published books I never had the final say or the control. Frankly, I didn't want it either. I trusted their judgment and moved on to my next work in progress. I didn't want to worry about covers.\nThen I found myself interested in self-publishing and things changed. There were two ways I could have gone with the cover for JSoDS. One was to go more erotic and show a bare-chested guy. The book does have an element of light BDSM and I made that clear in the blurb. The other way I could have gone was to play up the more emotional side of the book, where there's a kid in a wheel chair struggling to walk again with the help of the two main characters.\nSo when I sent the cover information to the cover artist I used for John Sweet, I asked her to focus more on the emotional parts in the book than the erotic parts simply because I thought they were more important to the book. And I was happy with the end result and loved the cover she created. I still love that cover.\nBut since the release of Jonah Sweet I've had people e-mail me asking for more details about whether or not there are erotic scenes in this particular book. I don't mind answering them and I've always encouraged this kind of communication. However, I ultimately decided to change the cover of Jonah Sweet to the one you see in this post above. It will go live sometime over the weekend and that's going to be the final cover for a while. NONE of the CONTENT of this book will be changed at all, not now or ever. When I released that book, like all the other books I've released, I was prepared to own my words and stand behind it regardless of what anyone else thinks.\nThis time I designed and created the cover myself. Though I'd never done anything like this before, I knew what I wanted, I didn't think anyone would be able to deliver it the same way I could, and I decided to learn how to design book covers myself. I'm not certain how long I'll be self-publishing or how many covers I'll design in the future. But it made perfect sense that since I'm doing this commando now, so to speak, it would only make sense to learn how to design e-book covers.\nFor those thinking about designing their own covers, all the information you need is out there on the web. You just have to google,\"How to design an e-book cover,\" and tons of web sites and youtube videos will pop up. I wanted something simple this time for Jonah Sweet, with simple print, and with masculine energy.",
    "question": "Why did the author decide to change the cover of the book \"Jonah Sweet of Delancey Street\"?",
    "answer": "The author decided to change the cover of the book \"Jonah Sweet of Delancey Street\" because he had received emails from people asking for more details about whether or not there are erotic scenes in the book. He thought the new cover would better represent the content of the book.",

    "context": "I arrived a week ago today. It takes about this long to mentally \u2018settle\u2019 in. To take in ones surroundings, the new environment, the new people and new daily habits. My mind has begun to let go of what was and be in what is \u2013 my reality of exploring, observing, making and interacting with this place. It feels unbelievably good to be surrounded by nature, to be a part of nature. The heavy rain pounding on my cabin roof the other night lulled me into a blissful sleep in part because it\u2019s been over two years since I\u2019ve had a direct roof over my head to enjoy such a sound. This place has reminded me of my deep need to be immersed in nature to feel whole, to be connected to not only to myself but the world around me in an honest way.\nThe last few days have been mostly damp. I\u2019ve still been out exploring, mostly collecting and finding spots to return when the sun reappears for an extended time (tomorrow!). I drove about 20 minutes into Sisters, the closest town and stocked up on provisions \u2013 groceries, a pair of fleece pants from the thrift store, scraps of muslin, sandpaper and a nice bottle of Oregon pinot noir. Sisters is decidedly trying to be like the old \u2018wild west\u2019. The facades of each building are structured from that time era and even the fonts of store names follow suit. It is a sweet square mile downtown and the bustle for a Monday morning was surprising, even at a bakery that primarily sells gluten-free pastries and six tantalizing types of yerba mate.\nDriving back the sunny weather and blue skies turned quickly into an engulfing snow storm! The artists from warmer climates are very excited to see snow- so there has been a stir of kid-like energy as it\u2019s been intermittently falling the last couple days. I myself just can\u2019t get over the shifts in weather. It will be overcast, downpouring and windy and the next minute the sun is shining through creating beautiful soft sunshowers cascading through the trees.\nYesterday Diana and I were determined to make it to the Pacific Crest Trail for a short hike. Within driving 10 minutes higher in elevation there was snow pack on the sides of the highway and even with snow treads on the wheels we got stuck in the unplowed road leading to our trailhead. Needless to say, I was ok with missing that hike, although it amazed me how quickly the climate changed\u2026 there isn\u2019t one patch of snow around Caldera. When we returned the sun was shining and what felt like mini-hail began to fall for about five mi\nnutes. Folowale, a dancer has become our resident \u2018rainbow chaser\u2019 and with weather like this he reports that he\u2019s constantly on the hunt!\nI\u2019m making, I\u2019m creating, I\u2019m experimenting, I\u2019m engaging in the creative process beyond just enjoying the beauty of the area which would be so\neasy to do. The wood-borer trails, lines \u2018drawn\u2019 by beetles in trees are fascinating. These intricate, organic marks in the wood beg to be noticed, beg to be traced and captured in some way. They in itself are a writing of place. They remind me of little maps, recordings of an insects existence; or a secret language, symbols of a dialect I cannot understand but want to decipher. I have spent countless hours searching and finding these intricate abstract patterns, collecting large shards of bark from the forest, sitting by the fire patiently as they dry so I can try to translate these marks into a visual language to share with others. I have documented the various patterns through sketches and photographs like a scientist trying to understand ancient tribal markings. I have researched their implications and discovered these enigmatic lines have deadly results. In multitude they can kill a tree, many trees and have destroyed forests. At least 80% of the trees on the ground here have evidence of these beetles. It feels like an anomaly yet is so natural, the cycles of life and death, how one thing destroys another to live. How can I be so taken with an insect that literally fells forests? Yet like the forest fire it is natural and something humans can\u2019t seem to quite understand or accept is this natural destruction.\nI discovered a way to record these markings. I outlined them with charcoal from the burnt forest and took photographs with average results. Then I tried rubbings, but the paper needed to be thin, not something I brought with me. Yet in the process of doing the rubbings on-site I noticed something by accident \u2013 the lines I had traced were being transferred on the back side of the paper. From years of doing graphite transfers, I immediately became excited at my discovery and tried it out on a good piece of paper. I was surprisingly impressed by the results.\nNotes from my sketchbook: \u201cSo I used charcoal to re-outline my previous markings of the insects trail. Then use my good paper, large graphite stick (wrapped in it\u2019s sleeve) to press and rub on the back. I can see the imprint coming through\u2026 I flip the paper over and am immediately excited- stunned at the beauty of line and texture process captured\u2026 like a wood block print\u2026 yes. I then tried it again\u2026 and again with black paper and white conte. Gorgeous. I can repeat overlay, the process/possibilities seem endless. \u2018I\u2019m so stoked\u2019 is not only for surfers.\u201d\nYesterday I spent a large portion of my day experimenting with the wood pieces I\u2019ve collected- using repetition, collage, mixed media and re-learning my printmaking skills to develop these pieces. By the end of the evening my mind was in overstimulation with the limitations, the possibilities and the effect these strong black and white visuals have on me.\nI can\u2019t wait until the sun peaks out again to dry up these trees so I can once again source directly from the forest. Until then my studio is looking more and more like the forest floor!",

I must confess that, despite my deep-seated and never-ending love for Demonology 101 it's not something that generally appeals to me: Monster-fighting is all well and good, but I had enough High School Drama during High School, thank-you-very-much. That said, the High School Drama aspect is never intrusive in The Paranormals and is generally more of a framework for the stories to work within, rather than a nuisance for the story to work around. So I can mostly ignore it and get on with the rest of it.\nThe cast of characters is diverse, interesting, and mostly likable (I could do without Persephone, but Neptra is always hilarious and so I can forgive). Preston, in particular, I like: his particular brand of snark always makes me snigger, and on the cast he has by far the most interesting abilities. Magic applied through technology? Programs coded in an ancient druidic language? Spells encoded into MP3s? Awesome.\nThe issues are episodic in nature, which is...alright, I guess. The only issue with that is that there doesn't feel like there's much tying them together and relating them. I realize this is a horribly unfair comparison, but Warren Ellis' Planetary tells a complete story with each issue, but still manages to make each issue feel like it's building towards something. You can see a point to the series underneath of it all. With the Paranormals you don't really get that, although this aspect has improved significantly with the last few installments.\nThe script is smart, and intelligent. It suffers slightly from Whedonism, where just about every exchange concludes with someone ribbing someone else or making a smart joke, which some people dislike. I love that sort of thing, though, so no issues there! Each character has its own voice, and is distinct from the others in the dialog. On occasion the comic veers a little into Preachy territory(Issue Four in particular) never too deeply or for too long.\nUnfortunately, the art does not match the writing in terms of quality.\nIn a word, the art is static. There's very little sense of movement between panels. Here's one particularly bad offender:\nThe glasses and newspaper look like they just TELEPORTED into place. No sense of transitional movement.\nThis is pretty important to me. Although this is again a horribly unfair comparison, John Romita Jr. is one of my favorite comic artists, despite his tenuous knowledge of anatomy and his repetitive faces. Why? Because he really knows how to make the page move. as far as I'm concerned, that's ten times more important than an artist's Still Figure drawing abilities.\nIn addition to that, the composition is...off. People are frequently just standing around, staring at the reader in unnerving fashion People never seem to be really looking at each other, and it's just...off.\nAlso, nobody should be subjected to this facial expression. Seriously, that's going to give me nightmares. It is a horror. Although that's an extreme example, the facial expressions are often weird, disturbing or sometimes downright bad.\nDespite all my ragging on the art, I will give it one prop: Rose's werewolf form reminds me of Bone. That's never a bad thing.\nAnd there we have it. For good or ill, that's my impressions.",

    "context": "Ferguson Must Have an American Response\nPeter Eisenstadt and Ayala Emmett\nAugust 28 2014\nMichael Brown, an unarmed 18 year old, shot and killed, his body uncovered, exposed to the sun for more than four hours\u2013was finally laid to rest on Monday. For the last time, and finally with dignity, Michael Brown a mothers child, a fathers namesake was surrounded, embraced, and mourned by family, friends, ordinary citizens, celebrities, clergy and politicians. So many people inside the church and outside paid their respects but America, or more specifically, white America\u2013with very few exceptions\u2013was absent. There were no visible white clergy and no 2016 political aspirants. It seemed that the Ferguson tragedy was black Americans grief.\nYet Ferguson is really an American tragedy and must have an American Response. Geographically located in Missouri, it is a familiar American catastrophe: a policeman shooting and killing an unarmed citizen: a young black man.\nFor days since the killing of Michael Brown, Fergusons racism has taken on contemporary tropes; armored vehicles carrying mounted guns, battle gear, stun grenades, and tear gas. Yet, all of these are familiar forms of violent response to grief that have a long history. They are firmly rooted in slavery that etched in American collective memory the practice of treating black peoples bodies as commodities and in subsequent denial of rights; Jim Crow, lynching, and segregation. Despite the advances made by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, many forms of racism have endured; segregated neighborhoods and schools, discrimination in the workplace, in voting rights, in the incarceration of vast numbers of young black men, and the constant feeling, particularly by young men, of being guilty until proven innocent\nMany of these issues are reflected in the question of police brutality. Now as in the past, disregard for life, for human dignity and for justice have corroded the social fabric. It has produced a Ferguson-like traumatized African American community in which the police are just a manifestation, albeit one with guns, that could shoot citizens with impunity yet are a part of the social fabric.\nAn e-mail that Ayala received from sociologist Dr. Karen Fields underscores this larger social fabric of race relation that cant be localized or neatly isolated. It\u2019s good for people to understand that police harassment is not a faraway \u201cthere\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 or that the victims are always young black men. I don\u2019t recall if I ever told you of being followed by Brighton police (in 2000) into the driveway of the home of a psychologist with whom I was acquainted. After the woman admitted me, the officer knocked, asked if she was all right, then engaged her (and she, them!) for at least 15 minutes, while I waited inside. Seeing my state after those 15 minutes, she offered me a sugar-loaded candy\u2026. I stood up and left as soon as I was able. It seems to me that woman had received the policing she paid for and took for granted when she moved into that nice neighborhood.\nDr. Fields writes, Back in 2011, I was stopped (with daughter Maimouna in the car) as I exited the street alongside Wal-Mart. We were fourth or fifth in line. I asked the young woman(!) what I had done wrong, and she answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d It went down from there. I made no effort to contradict her, or her older and more experienced partner. I didn\u2019t want to push a button of police mayhem.\nThe message that Dr. Fields and all black parents, citizens of this country,\nconvey to their children is that they, the parents, much like their ancestors during slavery are unable to protect them. The media in the days of vigils in Ferguson was replete with stories by ordinary and famous African American parents about talking to their sons on how to behave when confronted by police. What got displayed in Ferguson/America in essence are an intersection of the domestic: parental helplessness, and the political: that citizenship is not the same for blacks as it is for whites.\nThe question of black citizenship reminds us of what Howard Thurman had to say on the subject in his crucial study, Jesus and the Disinherited (1948.) For Thurman, one of the leading religious thinkers of the 20th century, and born poor and black in the Jim Crow South in 1899, the most significant difference between Paul and Jesus was that Paul was a Roman citizen, and Jesus was not. Jesus, and his followers, were afraid every time they saw Roman authority, a centurion, a Roman soldier, knowing that they could knock them into a ditch, or worse, and they would have no recourse, no legal way to address their problems. Paul on the other hand, was proud of being a Roman citizen, and it led to a complacency in his social thinking, including his condoning of slavery. It was this fear, and the accompanying emotions, hatred, and deception, that Jesus addressed in his ministry.\nThe situation, Thurman argued, between 1st century CE Palestine, and America at mid-century was not that different. There is no such thing as second-class citizenship. Its an all or nothing proposition, and for almost all black people in America it was nothing. Too many black were being killed, or having their lives ruined and stunted because they were not, in any meaningful sense of the term, American citizens. Things have changed since 1948, in some ways, immeasurably for the better. But the reality, as the Ferguson events have demonstrated to everyone with eyes to see, is that, still, far too many blacks are not American citizens, in any of the ways this really matters. Real equality is still a distant goal. The police, all too often, treat blacks as second-class citizens. And, we must all insist and try to make real, there are not, and cannot be any second class citizens",

They help assure that the business acquisition is successful and that the business continues to prosper well into the future.\nTips for \u201cHow to Successfully Buy a Business\u201d\nFirst they make sure the business opportunity of choice complies with all business with all the Federal, State and Local governmental regulations and that it is properly registered and is in good standing. Next, they find out if the business opportunity of interest provides an offering prospectus to buyers. If it\u2019s a business opportunity that falls under the FTC rule, then it\u2019s required to disclose specific information to the buyer.\nTo successfully buy a business, a buyer needs to keep in mind that buying a successful business with a several locations that has a successful ten year track record, the price for such established business will be higher than a business with a shorter track record. In the acquisition consideration of a more recently established business, the buyer should check out its history very carefully to make sure the sellers are not just dumping a bad business \u201cpainted for the market\u201d. In seeking guidance from a Merger & Acquisition Advisor or Investment Banker to evaluate the \u201cright\u201d business opportunity, the buyer would receive the following recommendations and guidelines:\n1. The buyer needs to make a honest evaluation of themselves and their abilities. If the buyer has been sitting behind a desk for many years, will they be happy calling on business people and selling them products or intangible service? Do they posses marketing and sales experience?\n2. The buyer must be prepared to run their business enthusiastically. Will they be happy introducing a new product or an unusual service that the public knows nothing about? Can they generate honest excitement for a product or service?\n3. The buyer must have complete knowledge of the product or service with which they will be involved. If the seller of the business gives the buyer little or no training in technical or management know-how, the buyer should be wary of the business opportunity. If the seller has organized all the operating knowledge into a standard operating manual, the buyer can look with favor upon such a business opportunity.\n4. The buyer should make a market evaluation of the product or service to be offered. Is the market likely to remain strong for the product or services for many years to come? Have competitors entered the market and will they become a threat to the business?\n5. Find out how many other companies have been in this industry successfully for a respectable period of time. A legitimate seller will provide a buyer with information to make them confident that they are making the right decision.\n6. Check the training and experience required to run the business properly. Is there a suitable curriculum of training? What is the scope of training and third party support? Does the buyer\u2019s background fit the requirements of operating this business successfully?\n7. What is the company\u2019s profit ratio to sales; to time and service requirements; and to the financial leverage requirements? Can the buyer make more in another type of business?\n8. Does the buyer have to work more hours to make the same amount of money as that of their current job? Can the buyer invest the same amount in the business opportunity yet operate a larger operation and get a better return on investment?\n9. Research company\u2019s history. Is it a newer company with a limited track record? Is it an older firm whose regular products have satisfied customers for years? Is in an older company whose products or services that have outlived their usefulness?\n10. Evaluate the company with the associations and business groups in which the company or seller is involved. Business owners in specific industries flock together via seminars and conferences and therefore get to know each other. Tapping into the grapevine within the industry can be very helpful in learning some inside information.\n11. The Better Business Bureau and similar groups collect complaints about a business. These groups will provide a report showing any previous complaints against the company.\n12.

Just got to keep trekking along and focus on the picture in my mind of the healthy, happy, radiant me :)\nRissa and her long time boyfriend broke up this past week so she really wanted to have a girls getaway weekend. We got a room at this cute boutique hotel downtown :) We went to dinner at this place called The Catacombs. Finding something on the menu that was vegan was practically impossible. Everything had either meat, cheese, or both. I ended up getting this cucumber tomato salad with kalamata olives, hold the feta, with some bread on the side for a bit more sustenance. I also ended up eating the crusts from Rissa's pizzas which felt a tad glutenous but maybe that's just the eating disorder talking.\nWe're such old ladies at heart, we turned in for the night after dinner. Ended up watching The Wedding Planner and Monster-In-Law on the teli and drank wine. Rissa had this idea we were going to drink two entire bottles of wine between the two of us in addition to the drink (plural for Rissa) we had with dinner. She was so funny nagging me to finish my wine so she could give me more. I'm not a crazy drinker and I barely drink a glass at a time. I'm not someone who likes drinking a lot- one glass is just find with me and I'll sip on it for the entire night. I don't get why it bothers the friends I hang out with that I only drink one glass, in comparison to their two or three or more glasses of alcohol.\nRissa is already asleep! I think it was the wine. She was hiccuping and everything haha. Reminds me of the disney movie Sleeping Beauty, when the mandolin player kept sneaking drinks while the two kings fought and ended up drunk, hiccuping and asleep under the table.\nI'm just chilling in the lobby of the hotel on my computer, thinking. Thinking about the future, thinking about whether or not I am going to choose health over Ed. The more I think about it, the more I want health. I'm slightly jealous of my friends who are giving into their eds...but I know it's not worth it. The price is too high and I'm not willing to pay with my life.\nDrunk girls are walking through the lobby in their sequined, too tight, too short dresses and mini skirts. I'm glad I'm staying here and not going out like them.\nIt's so definitely NOT worth it <3\nOne day, when your life is back on track and you're getting everything you SHOULD be getting/experiencing, you'll be glad you found the strength to abandon your EDs for your health, the courage to choose life over death.\nI'll pray for your friends, too.\nI think the up and down feelings are normal. I experience those too. I think the tricky part of ED is....when we are experiencing a good part of recovery, it tricks us back to it, it throws us wrenches, makes it harder. That is when we need to use our healthy coping skills and recovery tools. Use the reminders you mentioned about wanting \"to be healthy, fit, to radiate\". Keep reminding yourself of this, focus on these. They are not compatable with an ED. You can do this. Stay strong. You are doing wonderful and have made so much progress. Proud of you. We can do this!\n\"The price is too high and I'm not willing to pay with my life.\"\nPREACH.\nI think during those time you just really have to evaluate which is more important, losing weight and feeling small or \"I want to be healthy and fit. I want to radiate. I want to be at peace with my body instead of always fighting with it.\"\nI know it gets really frustrating wanting two things, but not being able to have both. Some of my friends are struggling a lot like yours. When I feel like I really want what they have, I force myself to think about eveything else that I DO NOT want that will come with it. I think about everything I have to sacrifice just to be thin. Its not worth it, you're right. Its hard, and I wish there was some way to get over it, but for now we just have to keep telling ourselves what we truely want in like and how we are going to get there. You can do it, keep your head up! <3",

    "context": "JEE Advanced 2014 Result Analysis Not in Favor of Regional Languages\nAt a time when all hell has broken loose \u2013 inside and outside the Parliament \u2013 to demand that the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should conduct the civil services exams in all the Indian languages, the results of the a recent experiment with the largest engineering entrance examination in India show that the move does not do much to improve the performance of the students that it intends to benefit.\nJEE Main 2014, which is the biggest all-India engineering test in the country, was conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in Marathi and Urdu too this year. Only a handful of students chose the new language options \u2013 and those who did could not perform well. Only 23 candidates, out of 758 Marathi-medium students qualified for JEE Advanced. Similarly, only 2 students, out of 300 Urdu-medium students, made it to the list of JEE Advanced qualifiers.\nTill 2012, all-India engineering entrance examination \u2013 then known as IIT JEE \u2013 was conducted only in English and Hindi. Last year, when JEE Main was introduced, Gujarat decided to accept its scores for admission to state-level engineering colleges too and scrapped its state-engineering entrance exam on the condition that students of the state are able to take the exam in Gujarati too.\nThis year, Odisha, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand joined the JEE system. Maharashtra demanded that its students should be allowed to appear for the engineering exam in Marathi and Urdu too \u2013 languages allowed in its state-level test. It is expected that as the states keep joining the JEE Main exam, more and more regional languages will be added to the list of available options.\nExperts argue that it might not be fair for Marathi-medium or Urdu-medium students to judge them by their ability to make it to the IITs as they might be competing only for the seats in state engineering colleges. But the fact remains that in face of the recent agitation against English in the civil services exam, these findings are quite significant.\nJEE Main 2014 result analysis comes with many insights relevant for the UPSC Civil Services Examination row, such as:\n- A senior CBSE official shared that most students who took JEE Main in Marathi and Urdu were from government schools and poor families. Their poor performance and weak success rate can be attributed to lack of coaching and guidance too. Most of the JEE coaching is either available in English or in Hindi (in some regions), is expensive and is concentrated in urban areas.\nState governments offer IAS coaching (for civil services exam) in regional languages for free but private IAS coaching institutes in urban areas mostly teach in English.\nAn IIT faculty member opines that even the JEE Main aspirants taking exams in regional languages can have a better success rate of they have adequate study material and training in the languages they choose. This trend can be seen in the case of Gujarat where even students from well-off families study in Gujarati medium. Hence, the success rate of students who took JEE Main in Gujarati is quite high.\n- Science education \u2013 at Class XII level \u2013 is mostly preferred in English. Hence, it is natural that engineering aspirants must have a grasp over the language. Regional languages do not do them much good at later stages.\nCivil services exam, however, does not test only science students. It is mainly a test of Humanities, which can easily be taught well in Indian languages and hence, civil service aspirants may perform better if they are allowed to take exams in the languages they are comfortable with.\nFormer Vice-Chancellor of the Central University of Bihar, Janak Pandey, pointed out, \u201cThese days when parents in rural areas too are admitting their students in English-medium schools, call from MPs to introduce regional languages in competitive exams may be against the drift of the times.\u201d\n- Excited\n- Fascinated\n- Amused\n- Bored\n- Sad\n- Angry\n- anil",

    "context": "Menlo Park, CA (April 23, 2002) - The first of four vaulting team selection trials is completed. Several hopeful teams left the Menlo Park Training Center without the qualifying score they had hoped for. Judges Adrienne Stang (FEI O) and J. Ashton Moore (FEI O) presided over this one day event.\nFive teams entered the competition and anxiously awaited the results. In the first round of compulsories every team struggled with the technical aspects of these required exercises. They each fell short of the required 7.0 qualifying score. Each vaulter, coach and longeur was aware that only an exemplary score in the freestyle round would be enough to raise their final score into the range which could be submitted to USA Equestrian for consideration to represent the United States at the World Equestrian Games (WEG) in Jerez, Spain in September. The competition was still wide open; less than one point separated the teams.\nOnly two teams were successful. The F.A.C.E. (Free Artists - Creative Equestrians) team of Moorpark, CA ruled on this day with the outstanding freestyle score of 8.810. The score was more than a point above the nearest competitor and enough to bring the team from third place position after compulsories to win the overall competition with a comfortable margin. F.A.C.E. was the AVA National Championship team in 2001 and represented the United States at the World Vaulting Championships in Mannheim, Germany in 2000. The team is coached by Devon Maitozo, men's world vaulting champion in 1998. The team horses Balanchine and Marshall carried them to victory.\nCoastline Vaulters of Santa Cruz, CA is a relatively new club and the first year they have applied to represent the United States in a World Championship. The team is coached by Katariina Alongi of Finland, who has raised the bar for these vaulters. This is the second year they have competed in the A Team arena and they received a credible second place-finish after compulsories with a score of 6.767. Coastline's third place finish in the freestyle round with a score of 7.280 placed them just behind the Woodside Vaulters of Woodside, CA. Coastline's combined compulsory and freestyle scores earned with their horse, Caneel, were enough to edge out the Woodside Team and finish second overall at the end of the competition.\nThree additional team selection trials are scheduled before the close on June 9, 2002. They will be held: May 5th at Flying Cloud Farm in Petaluma, CA; May 18th at The Garrod Farms in Saratoga, CA; and June 1-2 at Equestrian Performance Center, Moorpark, CA. These will be the only opportunities for the teams to acquire the three required qualifying scores.\nIndividual vaulters also had an opportunity to earn potential qualifying scores. Mari Inouye (18) of Palo Alto, CA lead the field of twelve women. She finished first overall with a score of 8.528. Inouye represented the Sundance Team with their horse, Faustus owned by Phoebe Cooke of Woodside, CA. Seven other women also earned scores of seven or higher to submit to USA Equestrian. They were: Jill Main (19), Samantha Smith (16), Julie Keville (19), Pam Geisler (24), Melissa Williams (18), Megan Benjamin (14) and Jessica Ballenger (19). Only Geisler and Inouye have represented the United States in previous world vaulting championships as individual competitors.\nIn the men's division all five competitors received scores above the seven point required score. Devon Maitozo (26) was the winner with a score of 8.273 just in front of Kenny Geisler (21) who placed second with a score of 8.445. Blake Dahlgren (17), Adrian Matsomoto (17) and Christopher Littmann (18) also earned scores which can be submitted to USA Equestrian for WEG consideration. Erik Martonovich of Golden, CO was entered in the competition, but withdrew after truck problems prevented the transportation of his horse Doc to the CA facility.\nOverall results appear below.

These banners are hard to read and the full message is not delivered to the users in the short period of time that you have their attention. Clear, simple and single-minded communication is the key to effective online advertising.\nThink carefully about what you want to communicate on the creative and simplify as much as possible. Split the messaging into different banner variations if you need to, but make sure that your message comes across clearly.\nActionable call-to-action\nThis is something that all digital media are familiar with, but is possibly one of the most important. Every piece of digital media that you release into the wild needs to have a strong call-to-action. If your banner does not ask the customer to engage in some way then you can bet that they won\u2019t engage at all.\nYour call-to-action should be prominent, clear and informative giving the user a reason to engage with your creative. If possible try experimenting with several different call-to-actions and then optimise based on the most effective one.\nDelivering on the promise\nYour creative message and call-to-action builds up a level of expectation for the user. If you showed product A and asked the user to \u201cbuy now\u201d, when the user clicks on your banner they expect to be taken to a page where they can buy that product. Logical, I know, but you would be surprised how often advertisers get this wrong and end up sending the user to the homepage instead. Make sure that your landing page is relevant and delivers on the promise that you banner creative has made.\nImproving the user journey and ease of user not only provides the user with a much better experience but also increases the effectiveness of your campaign by minimising drop-off and increasing conversion ratios. Make sure that you spend time planning your campaign architecture and thinking about how the user interacts with each stage. Getting this right will determine the difference between success and failure.\n2 thoughts on \u201cGetting your online User Experience right\u201d\nThanks Matthew, can never do with enough reminders on these points, considering the little and distracted time that consumers have for advertisers and products.\nThanks Andy!",

The plan calls for increasing that depth to 50 feet.\nNOLA.com | The Times-Picayune reported that the Army Corps plans to use some of the dredged-up silt to make more than 1,460 acres of new wetlands.\nThe Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development would pay $45.7 million of the estimated $88.9 million cost.

She called to say that it wasn't going to work out with our kids. That Cody had hit her daughter (Cody said that she had hit him first), that other things came out, that the mix wasn't going to work. She said that she knew we were working \"on issues\" but she just didn't want to risk it, blah, blah, blah. I just listened and said, \"okay, okay, okay\". How can you argue against someone who's so immediately certain about things?\nI can't tell Cody at the moment; he's ultra sensitive to the rejection side of things. I don't feel like a couple of hours of intense counseling right now.\nI'm so mad and sad once again. Mad at Christian-mothers with formulas and no grace. She was so matter-of-fact about her standard and rejection. I'm just sad at mine and Cody's plight of being ostracized from the group that we belong to.\nHowever, I know that, although she is representative, she's not the only kind out there. So, I shall just trust once again that we'll find our way somehow.\nMore reports to come.\n2 comments:\nSorry to hear(read)this. How disappointing:-(\nYep, onward, upward. Thanks.",

    "context": "This months theme was Myths and Monsters and I had made a prediction on the book; I was correct! The box wasn't inspired by any specific YA novels, but they did suggest it for anyone who liked magic, fantasy, unicorns, Phoenixs and dragons, etc. This is most definitely a box intended me. I couldn't miss out on the anniversary edition either!\nOnce again there are purple curls all over the floor and I got things out in a hurry. The first item I got out was a set of fairylights! They're in the shape of unicorns and rainbows and are absolutely beautiful! They're battery powered which is brilliant, because I already have a set of electric ones wrapped around my bed. These, I plan on attaching to my book case somehow when I move house. I now have three sets of fairylights but these were so so different and interesting. They feature in quite a few pictures I've taken of the box today.\nThe next item was inspired by another mythical creature. It was a candle by a company called Geeky Clean and it was called Nephilm. It smells really sweet and I loved it. I'm now building up a collection of unused bookish candles, and against I am saving these for the new flat! Alongside the candle was a small pocket mirror, with a mermaid on (I know the picture of this is awful, but I was relying on my phone camera, I am sorry!)!\nI came across another myth inspired item; a set of book marks! First of all I absolutely love this style of bookmark! There was a little dragon and a phoenix. This was easily one of my favourite items in this months box. I almost don't want to use them as I have a habit of carrying paperbacks around in my very full tote bags, even though I don't have time to read them that day.\nMy absolute favourite item? The scarf! It is grey and is patterned with dragon scales, and has the words 'Fairy Loot printed at the bottom! I've included it in the photos of the box as a whole, It is so light and absolutely beautiful. I think it looks like mermaid scales. But whether it be dragon scales, or mermaid scales it sure is gorgeous.\nOkay, this months book was a little predictable but I am still absolutely thrilled. Fairy Loot provided me with a copy of Laini Taylor's Strange The Dreamer. Having just started her other series, beginning with A Daughter of Smoke and Bone I am very excited. I am twenty percent into A Daughter of Smoke and Bone and it is captivating. I am struggling to put it down at the moment! Strange The Dreamer will be the one I read after this, and I cannot wait. Expect full reviews of both books, guys! Oh and this editon of Strange The Dreamer is limited edition in the UK; with the edges of the pages being sprayed blue. It really is beautiful.\nIt has been a long day and I have just got home from a second trip to the cinema to see Beauty and the Beast. I have so much to do but really need to catch up on sleep so I can stop complaining about it here! Sorry guys!\nOh! On a side note; I now have a twitter! I have no idea what I'm doing with it yet but I'm sure I will sort it out soon. Feel free to head over there and follow me! I attempted to be funny and sound clever at the same time. Turns out I am neither, and am still clueless with regard to Twitter. Tips are welcome!\nI'm working on a post about self love/care at the moment, too. So you can look forward to that in the next few days. For now, I am returning to my forum post assignment before bed.\nGood night guys, have a good week!",

    "context": "THE FARMER FAMILY\n.JPG)\n.JPG)\nWelcome to our blog \"The Thread to Mylee\"! Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we ventured into this journey called adoption. My name is Gina Farmer and my husband is Donnie. We have 3 biological children; Whitney (22), Dillon (14) and Peyton (11), and an adopted daughter from China, Maci (2).\nWe actually got the idea to adopt from China by attending a Steven Curtis Chapman concert. During the concert, God was really working on Donnies heart. During intermission he told me he was going to get some information on adopting from China. I was totally taken by surprise, but overwhelmed with joy!\nBut how could we afford this? We knew that if God had spoke to our hearts to adopt, He would take care of the financial end of it. Philippians 4:19 says \"And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.\" We adopted our beautiful daughter, Maci Marie JiaoLe Farmer on Christmas Day 2006! She has been such a blessing to our family and has brought us nothing but pure joy! We thank God for little Maci each and every day!\nBut God wasn't finished there! He spoke to me and Donnie yet again. So with great faith and little hesitation, we have started the paperwork to adopt another little girl from China. We will name her Mylee.\nDebbie Wankel, a very special friend, called me one day and asked if I had thought about starting a blog to raise money for our adoption. She offered to help make hair bows and hand-made cards to sell. She even used her own money to get it started. Debbie and her husband are in the process of adopting a little girl from Ethiopia.\nOur prayer is to raise above and beyond what we need to adopt little Mylee. We will then use the money we have raised to start a fund to help other families adopt internationally. Many families can afford the day to day expenses of raising a child, but cannot afford the inital cost of adoption. We want to help those families experience the same love and joy we have had by welcoming a beautiful child into their family. God bless!",

Such themes encourage creativity and empower website owners to run their business in such a way that the promotional power is maximized. Despite the large variety of themes and designs, those who spend a lot of time visiting fashion websites are aware of the fact that the resemblance between many of them is uncanny.\nA magento fashion theme is all about customization and with the users having it easy to update both the content and the look of their store, they can always come up with a unique design. The benefits of using Magento go way beyond aesthetics, and those who use it intensely praise it for the how easy it is to customize an item presentation depending on category or product. There are no obstacles for those who want to load several themes at the same time and then shift between the regular design and a fresh one.\nAll it takes to adjust the shoes Magento template and tweak it in such a manner that visitors would only be pleasantly surprised, are a few keystrokes. Many are attracted by the neat and appealing visuals, but worry about lacking the knowledge of using Magento, but they have no reasons to be intimidated. A strong community of knowledgeable members and the sheer simplicity of the web application, will make guidance rarely necessary and anyway, easy to find.\nWhether you run a blog revolving around fashion and the latest outfits, or a professional store that strives to increase its revenue, you can\u2019t afford to neglect aesthetics.

Some people struggle with the thought of growing older and eventually needing support from other people to live. As terrifying as these thoughts might be, it would be even more terrifying to be facing that situation without having prepared a plan for it. While still in a sound state of mind, it is best to consider possible scenarios that can occur and be prepared for it. When creating an estate plan with the help of an attorney, the following situations should be planned for:\nMedical decisions\nThese are especially important to be made while people are still in a sane disposition. This includes designating power of attorney to a close loved one for making decisions about medical treatment in case a person becomes incapacitated or loses the ability to make sound decisions. If you should eventually suffer from dementia you will be grateful that you at least got to choose someone you know you can trust to care for you.\nMobility issues\nWith aging comes the deterioration of our senses and acuity. There may come a time when you become unfit to operate a vehicle. If it comes to that, alternate arrangements should be prepared so that you don\u2019t lose your independence. Driving aside, you may eventually require the use of a wheelchair to get around. You will want to be in an environment that appropriately supports your transportation needs, including being wheel-chair accessible.\nWoodside Estate issues and the people responsible for them\nMost people immediately think about how they want to distribute their assets to their heirs. There are many issues that need to be considered before you can leave assets to your beneficiaries. Estate taxes need to be accounted for, debts and liabilities settled, and documents validated. One of the most important things you need to consider is who you would like to be the executor of your will. This responsibility dictates that your wishes will be fulfilled in accordance to your instructions. You also need to think about to whom you will bestow power of attorney to for financial and legal decisions, whether you are alive or not.\nEnd-of-life concerns\nThese issues need to be discussed early on so that your family will know what to do in the worst case scenario. If you wish to create a do-not-resuscitate order to avoid being in a vegetative state, this should be dictated in your estate planning. Your funeral arrangements, designated persons for power of attorney, and other things should be arranged.\nMaking plans for worst case scenarios is generally not a pleasant thought. However, should these challenging situations ever happen to you, you would be much better off if you had prepared for it. When talking about your plans for the future with your spouse, children, or parents, it might be easier to have an estate planning attorney around to guide you through the process and make your planning experience much easier for you.\nSome interesting facts about the area:\nFrom Wikipedia:\nWoodside is a middle.\nYou can click here for a nice Legal & Courts Google Map for Woodside NY.

Apparently Amazon has a whole HOST of hilarious and amazing products. Here are just a few (dozen) that I absolutely LOVED. Here are my top favourites:\nThe Yodeling Pickle! (Only 1 left in stock!!) Wait, did they actually stock more than one of these? Or are they trying it out on Amazon to see if anyone would ACTUALLY buy a yodeling pickle? Part of me wants to buy it just for the sheer bizareness of it! Apparently, you can buy them used, too. Other people who have had their fill of surprising friends and family by making their pickle yodel are making their used pickle available for others to enjoy!\nRemember that dream where you were an octopus, gliding lightly along the bottom of the ocean? You majestically waved your tentacles and explored your watery world, while looking for tasty prey. Now you can do this ON LAND with a set of five-finger tentacles! You can be a bona-fide Pentapus! Get two sets and you can be a Decapus! Get some for your toes and you could be an Icosapus?

Climb walls, and crush small animals in your strong tentacular grip!\nSave yourself from embarrassing accidents, cover up itchy psoriasis, or just look plain COOL in these epic handerpants gloves!

There\u2019s no excuse for not having a pair of these. It would be great if I could have my little toes poking out of the snug security of a pair of tighty whities \u2013 Please make Feetderpants!\nDental hygiene becoming a bore? Wish you had some flavour to rub between your pearly whites? Mint getting you down?? Accoutrements has the solution for you! Tasty Ranch flavoured dental floss!

I digress. Back to the magical fantastical-ness of the narwhal. Personally, I\u2019ve always wanted a narwhal. What a great family pet! You can go on a ride together, spear fish and other sea-creatures together, and crap in the water together (because that\u2019s what water animals do. They crap in the water. It\u2019s really gross). Anyhoodle, I don\u2019t have a pool big enough for a narwhal, and I don\u2019t live close enough to the lake to keep one there, either. And then I found THIS!

    "context": "Carlo Rovelli: \u2018Science is where revolutions happen\u2019\nThe physicist and bestselling author on the radical politics and drugs of his youth, his life\u2019s work and why we all need a break\nCarlo Rovelli is professor of physics at Aix-Marseille University. He is a pioneer in research into quantum gravity which seeks to integrate Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics, specifically by removing the idea of time. Rovelli\u2019s slim book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics became an international bestseller last year, outselling Fifty Shades of Grey in his native Italy. His new book, Reality Is Not What It Seems, describes the development of physics from classical Greece to the present day. This interview was conducted on the phone with Rovelli at his home in Marseille.\nWere you surprised by the great success of your book, of the appetite for theoretical physics?\nI did not expect it at all. It is translated in 41 languages. I expected just a few thousand copies sold. I think it is because the book offers a perspective on science that also talks about beauty and emotions \u2013 I don\u2019t think those things should ever be separated from science.\nYou began with a tale of Einstein, before he proposed his theories, loafing around, drifting. Do you think that state of mind is useful for scientists?\nI think the great leaps of knowledge are made when one steps back, and forgets, and explores different things. Darwin got on a boat and went round the world and that freed his mind from the thinking in Oxford and Cambridge at the time. If he hadn\u2019t gone on his voyage perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have had the liberty for his discovery.\nDo you try to incorporate that freedom in your own life?\nI have certainly wandered around a lot. I graduated very late. I was a bad student. I travelled. I did a lot of politics in the 70s. I still try to keep my perspective as open as possible.\nI read that back then you experimented with hallucinogenic drugs. Has that helped your thinking on the nature of reality?\nI think we are all trapped in our habits of perception in some ways. It is not that you take drugs and you solve physics problems. Not at all! But it maybe helps in losing the idea that what we see is reality.\nYou have long been trying to prove the idea of quantum gravity. Do you wake up with that goal in mind?\nIf we could get empirical confirmation it would be fantastic. Nothing is very solid yet, but I am working on some astrophysical signals and trying to connect them with the theory. So I do wake up excited about that. I am 60. Having that kidlike excitement every day is a great privilege.\nHow long have you lived with that ambition?\nI was around 26 when I discovered the idea of quantum gravity. The scale is very small: 10-33 centimetres. One day when I was doing my PhD I took a piece of paper and wrote 10-33 centimetres in red, very large and stuck it on the wall. And that was going to be my aim, to try to work out what was happening at that scale.\nThe poster must have been a tricky thing to explain to your friends and girlfriends at the time?\nYes and no. My friends saw my passion and I loved trying to explain it.\nAt the same time you were interested in radical politics in Italy. Were the two things connected in your mind?\nI moved from one to the other. I was taken by trying to change the world through politics in the 70s. But in Italy there was a transition from great hope to disappointment in that period. It was at that point I thought there is another place where revolutions happen, and that is in science.\nI guess in some ways the complexities of Italian politics made theoretical physics a walk in the park?\nYes, absolutely. Or at least it was a good way into thinking about the nature of reality.\nYou started a radio station back then?\nI was a student in Bologna and we started this pirate station, Radio Alice, like Alice in Wonderland. It was in the centre of town and anyone could come in and talk about what was on their mind. It was fantastic for a while.\nIt sounds a good model for research?\nYes, science is always a matter of exchange of ideas. It has never been about national borders or whatever. Most of my work is talking and listening to people.\nSome of your own collaboration has been with your partner [and former student] Francesca Vidotto. It sounds like a proper meeting of minds?\nI have written a book with Francesca but she lives in the Netherlands. All relationships are different but I think ours works very well. She has very different skills from mine, but there are also new things happening, always new things to talk about.\nI\u2019m sure you need a degree of optimism to keep looking for answers to complex questions. Are you ever undone by doubt?\nMy normal day is to do pages of calculations and then throw them away. Part of what I do is accepting that I might have spent my whole life trying to prove a theory that is wrong. I hope it\u2019s right. But you always have to accept the opposite is possible. If you want certainty, science is a bad place to look. But if you want reliability and probability, science is the best place to go.\nDo you have a sense of mortality?\nI have always had it. I believe our life is just a few numbered years. I am very serene with that. If I died today or tomorrow I would feel I have done what I can. If I have more years and can do more, then great. The more we accept what we are \u2013 mortal \u2013 the better we can live.\nDid you ever have a religious faith?\nWhen I was about 20 I thought a lot about it. And I decided I was not interested in it except as a natural phenomenon. As a philosophy I have been attracted by Buddhism. I think it comes naturally to a scientist in that it talks about impermanence and nothing being solid. I have done some meditation, but I am too busy really.\nHow do you relax?\nI love living by the sea. I have an old sailing boat, 100 years old, very beautiful. If I am stressed I take it out, concentrate on sailing and not falling in the water, and by the time I come back everything is always back in place in my head.\nReality Is Not What It Seems by Carlo Rovelli is published by Allen Lane (\u00a316.99).Click here to order a copy from Guardian Bookshop for \u00a313.93\nView all comments >",

CocoBase\nEnterprise O/R 3.1 allows users to substantially cut costs for\ndevelopment of E-Commerce applications by dramatically reducing\nthe amount of coding necessary to create the Enterprise JavaBeans\nthat many e-commerce sites rely on. This 5th major upgrade of\nthe product from the leader in object-oriented mapping technology\nfor Enterprise JavaBeans delivers many new features for E- Commerce\napplications, including support of all of the leading servers,\ndynamic client side querying and dynamic mapping of tables. These\nnew features add additional support companies needing to meet\ntheir return on investment (ROI) requirements for E-commerce solutions.\nThought Inc.'s focus on cost savings, ease of development and\nbroad base of industry support provides CocoBase customers like\nGTE Inc., AppNet Inc. and Perot Systems a major competitive advantage.\n\"As consultants specializing in application delivery, TRC\nhas integrated the GemStone and CocoBase products very successfully\non several large-scale projects,\" said John King, Director\nfor The Technical Resource Connection (TRC), a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Perot Systems Corporation. \"Packaging these two software\nproducts together is an excellent and timely decision. The strengths\nafforded to the developer by packaging these complementary products\nmakes it an obvious winner.\"\nOne of the main features of CocoBase Enterprise O/R v3.1 is the\nability to automatically generate all of the database access code\nfrom a map of the underlying data instead of writing the access\nby hand. This feature alone cuts the development time from around\n40 hours to create a fully functional Entity Bean for EJB to Minutes!\nCocoBase provides tightly integrated Entity Bean support for Container\nManaged Persistence and Bean Managed Persistence that is portable\nacross EJB Application Servers such as; BEA Weblogic 5.1, Gemstone/J,\nIBM's WebSphere, Inprise's Application Server, IONA's iPortal\nServer, iPlanet's (a Sun - Netscape Alliance) NAS Server, JONAS\n(open source) Application Server, Object Spaces' Voyager and Sybases'\nEA Server.\n\"Our integrations with the leading EJB Servers providing\nEntity bean support for both Container and Bean Managed Persistence,\noffers a complete development platform for Database Access with\nEJB applications. CocoBase Enterprise O/R delivers the most flexible,\nportable and customizable EJB Persistence on the market,\"\nsaid Ward Mullins, CTO of THOUGHT Inc.\nContainer Managed Persistence (CMP) allows developers to build\nEJB components without having to directly deal with persistence\nduring development. While Bean Managed Persistence (BMP) requires\nthat developers write a certain amount of persistence code. The\nuse of CMP reduces the need for a developer to understand or to\nimplement persistence code, which can dramatically speed up and\nsimplify development. In contrast, the use of BMP makes it easier\nfor the developer to edit and customize persistence code during\ndevelopment. While BMP delivers much needed flexibility to a developer,\nit also increases the complexity which CocoBase Enterprise O/R\nmanages for you. With the use of CocoBase Enterprise O/R, the\ndeveloper finds little difference in building applications using\neither CMP or BMP.\nOther features that are important in this release are; 1) the\nability to Dynamically Query from the client both regular Java\nand EJB applications through a QueryBuilder library. (which is\nincluded as source code.) 2) Dynamic Mapping of database tables\nso that in one step all of your tables can be mapped, thus saving\ntime.\n\"Development, deployment and maintenance cost savings coupled\nwith ease of use across EJB servers are what we deliver to customers\nwho are building E-Commerce applications.\" said Dan Wilson,\nVice President of Sales and Marketing, THOUGHT Inc. \"Our\nability to work with virtually any EJB Server ensures that companies\nhave the flexibility to meet ever changing requirements without\nlosing ROI.\nAbout CocoBase Enterprise O/R\nCocoBase Enterprise O/R provides\na powerful standard for bridging the fault companys' patented flagship product\nand the industry's most advanced framework for accessing legacy\ndata in a distributed application since March of 1997. Since that\ntime, THOUGHT Inc. founders have successfully provided solutions\nfor customers deploying applications on the Worldwide Web and\nhave gained a reputation for excellence with Object Mapping.

Where others obfuscate and dumb down, Hercules aestheticize and elevate.\" AV Club declared \"THE FEAST OF THE BROKEN HEART\" to be \"the most adventurous record yet from Hercules & Love Affair. The house and techno elements are immediate and occasionally aggressive, but there's great warmth and intimacy here as well.\" \"Butler's troupe have always been unique,\" noted Resident Advisor, \"a dance floor-friendly manifestation of the dissenting, politicized queer underground -- but now they're making transcendent music again, too.\" \"THE FEAST OF THE BROKEN HEART\" is \"a taut and focused piece of work, full of ridiculously propulsive and catchy anthems, and there's not a bad song on it,\" decreed Stereogum, adding,\" If you have any love in your heart for old-school house music, you should hear it at least once.\".\"\nLong hailed as a transcendent live act, Hercules & Love Affair is currently rocking the house on a major European tour encompassing headline dates, festival appearances, and a number of exclusive Andy Butler DJ sets.\nFor more information / log on\nherculesandloveaffair.net/\ntwitter.com/HerculesLA\ninstagram.com/herculesandloveaffair\nSee all RSS Newsfeeds\nView Image: S M L",

I want to eat it again but alas, I have no mozzarella.\nPhooey.\nI finally COMPLETELY finished the one and only dress I\u2019ve made for K (so far\u2026).\nI added some rosettes by the straps (possibly to cover up some *cough* imperfections *cough*) and some ribbon trim on the bottom. She actually wore it out in public, to church, on Sunday. We took her to the church nursery and the lovely lady that works there immediately said, \u201cOh, did Mommy make you a dress?!\u201d I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to take that. Hmmmm\u2026.\nSome handsome dude I know started school on Monday.\nHe keeps telling me there is going to be \u201clots\u201d of homework but I have yet to see any. And today when I asked him how his day was he said, \u201cSame as yesterday\u2026 gosh Mom!\u201d Does that start already? If so, I\u2019m not ready for it.\nHe told me he wanted to ride the bus this year (he would only ride it home since Tim drops him off in the mornings) but he decided against it right now since he feels it\u2019s too hot to walk home from the stop. Can\u2019t say that I blame him one bit. We\u2019ll see what he wants to do when it cools off\u2026\nHe also lost another tooth over the weekend and another one is loose. AND! get this! The \u201ctooth fairy\u201d FORGOT to visit on the first night. He told me his \u201cbest idea\u201d was that I was the tooth fairy and that I forgot.\nI think the jig might be up soon\u2026 what about y\u2019all?\nFile under, too smart for his own britches.

And yes, he sounds WAY too smart for YOUR own good. \ud83d\ude09\nThe dress is very pretty, I like!!\nAnd 2nd grade? That is a big deal! (gah they grow up so quickly!)\nLove the dress \u2013 great job!!!!\nYour son is gonna be a heartbreaker, such a cutie! I love those rosettes you added to the dress. Adorable!!\nWhatevs, that dress is darling! You rocked it lady!\nThe jig is up here too\u2026and no one has lost any teeth here yet!! He is under strict instructions to keep it to himself and nit tell other kids.\nYour lunch looks delicious and I\u2019m so impressed with your sewing skills! She looks adorable in the dress. Cute first day photo! When my son rode the bus in kindergarten he came home upset because the a/c was broken. I had to explain that the buses don\u2019t have a/c!\nI am impressed with the dress. I do NOT sew. And great first day picture. Such a cutie!\nAwesome job on the dress! And that was a total compliment. Awwwww, B is growing up. Still offering an almost 14 year old to ya! A T T I D U D E !!!!\nAnd that should have said ATTITUDE! UGH!\nPerhaps she just noticed that a pattern that cute can\u2019t just be bought in a store. I think it looks great. I wish I could sew, but I get pissed at the sewing machine before I get two stitches done, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work out.\nBaby Girl lost another tooth last night and she said, \u201cwhat if YOU were the tooth fairy?\u201d And I calmly said, \u201cwhat if I was?\u201d But in a way not really admitting that I was. And she replied, \u201cwell then YOU would have to put money under my pillow.\u201d I definitely think we are getting close to that not being a \u201cthing\u201d in our house any longer.\nThe other day, we heard Jacob say to his cousin that Santa wasn\u2019t real.

That almost made me cry\u2026but we couldn\u2019t decide if he really thought that or was just fishing, you know?\nSmart kids break my heart a little\u2026\nWhen my youngest daughter was four, she stood outside the bedroom door as my husband and 8 year old discussed the fact that Santa, Easter bunny, and Tooth Fairy were all ficticious but wasn\u2019t it fun all the same? yadda yadda. Boom. There went my 4 year old\u2019s innocence! Gone like that (snapping fingers.)

Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?\u201d\n2 Chronicles 35:21, Pharaoh Necho of Egypt is on his way to fight against the Babylonians at Carchemish, and King Josiah of Judah is foolish enough to get in his way: \u201cJosiah marched out to meet him in battle. 21 But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, \u201cWhat quarrel is there, king of Judah, between you and me?\u201d \u2013 LXX, \u03a4\u03af \u1f10\u03bc\u03bf\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bf\u03af \u2013 \u201cIt is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war.\u201d\nBut Jesus\u2019 statement refers most (\u03a4\u03af \u1f10\u03bc\u03bf\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bf\u03af;). In both texts the narrative reveals a reluctant prophet who is called upon to provide for one in need, a need the prophet sees as an unwanted involvement.\nIn all these passages the complaint is, \u201cWhat have I done to you that you are causing me trouble unjustly?

    "context": "The Seeds of (Under)Development are Sown Early\nNext month we are hosting a major policy workshop on the coordination of care for orphans and vulnerable children between the various government ministries, major donors and NGO\u2019s operating the field. This week I was fortunate enough to join our documentation team in a rural community in the North to capture the thoughts and views of those on the ground: district welfare officers, administrators of community based organisations (CBO\u2019s) and most importantly of all \u2013 the children themselves.\nZambia has a combined education enrollment rate of about 60% which places it 130th out of the 172 countries that the UN tracks. Consequently there has been a big push on school enrollment since the start of the century with school lists growing at over 10% a year i.e. the total number of children in school has more than doubled in less than a decade. Commendable as this, the number of teachers retained has stayed more or less constant so unfortunately the ratio of teachers to children has also doubled over the same period.\nAs part of the major market reforms the country underwent in the early 1990\u2019s, Zambian children can now only expect free education only up until grade 7 (roughly 12 years old). After this point they have to pay some fairly significant attendance and exam fees. At all ages they are expected to have sufficient money to pay for uniforms, books and of course transport should they need it. This leads to many children dropping in and out of education (particularly at secondary level) as and when their parents can afford to send them. There were several 16 and 17 year old students in the 8th grade class we visited. It was not always thus, during the times of Kenneth Kaunda (post independence and pre market reforms) education was generally free and anecdotally at least, children from that era appear to have benefited from a more comprehensive education.\nOur program works with the relevant government departments and local CBO\u2019s to identify those families most disadvantaged and provide them with sufficient support (from pigs and goats, to cash grants, uniforms and shoes) to enable them to get back or stay in school. It also makes a big effort to engage the government services in the area to ensure that there is co-ordination of this support. Sadly this is not as commonplace as you would hope with multiple NGO\u2019s operating in the same locations.\nEncouragingly at a local level the support does appear to be having its intended impact and we heard stories of children who were able to resume their education from our project. But as the local coordinator so elegantly put it \u2013 \u2018Our work here is just a drop in the ocean, there are so many families who need our help and so few who we can give it to\u2019\nSo when we asked the children to draw and write messages for their government and donors, what did they say? Well perhaps predictably quite a few asked for footballs and books. Tellingly, some asked for new wells to be drilled to accommodate with drinking water their growing numbers of classmates. Finally, at a community school which does not yet qualify for full government support, many petitioned for the building of accommodation and electricity for their teachers. The class supervisor explained that at present even the headmaster commutes over 20km each way by bicycle over very poor dirt track. A journey that is just about achievable in the dry season often becomes impossible in the wet leading to frequent school closures. The lack of electricity supply is also a major barrier to attracting talented teaching staff from the urban centers.\nA number of recent studies have illustrated that the stress associated with poverty has a profoundly negative impact on a child\u2019s ability to learn. These studies, conducted in rich industrialised countries with developed social security systems, showed that the stress of poverty alone was sufficient to explain a significant and meaningful decrease in a child\u2019s capacity to form working memories and hence benefit from their education. Issues of hunger, disease, illness and parental loss are extremely common in Zambian households when compared to the US subjects in the study so one can only imagine the impact such events have on the overall capacity of Zambian children to reach their full potential.\nA well educated population is something like water in a well, you only miss it when it has gone. It has struck me, on several occasions since first arriving in Zambia, the toll that a broadly reduced level of education takes on the country as a whole. It rears its head in many ways \u2013 some petty and small such as the length of time it takes to navigate simple bureaucratic procedures, some large and meaningful such as a concern about the supply of qualified and capable individuals to lead private organisations and the government at all levels.\nIt is not uncommon to hear foreigners and well educated Zambians (from that past generation) seething about the \u2018lack of efficiency\u2019 in the country. Yet when you get the opportunity to visit their schools, you begin to understand how several of the fundamental building blocks of an educated (and consequently efficient) society are severely strained and in some cases simply not present at all.",
    "question": "What challenges are faced by the education system in Zambia?",
    "answer": "The education system in Zambia faces several challenges. The country has a combined education enrollment rate of about 60%, placing it 130th out of the 172 countries that the UN tracks.

    "context": "A few years ago, Heather placed first in a contest when I only finaled. We both found our agents around the same time and went through rounds of revisions. Her novel sold, and mine... um, still waiting. Jealousy? No. Kick in the pants inspiration? Yes. Heather's winning entry in that contest blew me away and motivated me to dig deeper into my craft. She's had her share of setbacks, but she persevered and encouraged me every step of the way. I hope her success story inspires you too.\nTell us about your book and your journey to publication.\nI\u2019ve been writing for children for over fourteen years. Whew! That seems like a long time, but in this business, it\u2019s not really that long. I had mentored with a poet in college and had been a writer for TV, newsprint, and marketing, but I had to sharpen my children\u2019s/YA writing skills. So I attended a trillion conferences, took various classes, and published some short stories for young children before I discovered I\u2019m truly comfortable in a sixteen-year-old\u2019s voice.\nI wrote the first version of my Contemporary Realistic YA novel, currently titled RIPPLE, back in 2008. It was a very personal book that introduced teens dealing with some rarely discussed compulsions and struggles. I received some attention from it back then at conferences, but the comments on it were that it was long, wordy, and needed serious tightening. By the time I\u2019d finished editing, TWILIGHT was out and paranormal was all the rage, so when I pitched it at conferences again, editors and agents wanted to know, \u201cIs there a fairy in it? A werewolf? Living gargoyles?\u201d\nAlas, it was just about a girl with some real-life issues, which made it a tough YA sell at the time. I believed in it, though, so I thought I\u2019d use my poetry-writing background and turn the crux of it into a short story in verse. That story, \u201cHim,\u201d won the 2011 Katherine Paterson Prize for YA and Children\u2019s Writing through HUNGER MOUNTAIN, the literary journal of the Vermont College of Fine Arts. That same year I won first place in the Children\u2019s/Young Adult Fiction division of the WRITER'S DIGEST Annual Writing Competition for a different short story. Contests are such a great way to get your work noticed, and 2011 was a very good year for me in that respect.\nHow did you get your agent?\nAfter I won the Katherine Paterson Prize, several agents contacted me via email. The first was Heather Schroder, an extremely seasoned agent, who at the time was with International Creative Management (ICM) and has since started her own agency, Compass Talent. We set up a phone conversation, and I really loved how she just got what I was trying to do with \u201cHim.\u201d She really connected with my writing style and my work, so I knew she was a great fit for me.\nI had already started working on a dystopian/fantasy-type novel when Heather contacted me, so she helped me work through several revisions of that. But again, the market shifted, and back came the popularity of Contemporary Realistic Fiction in YA. That old novel from 2008 had a shot now! So I revised RIPPLE to make the voice and the structure relevant for today\u2019s YA readers, and Heather sold it to Penguin Putnam a short while later. It's scheduled to be released in Fall 2016.\nWhat has been surprising or challenging about your experience?\nI am an impatient human, and, I mean, like, really impatient. I want things done now and before now. So getting used to the publishing industry, which often moves at a glacial pace, has really taught me to take deep breaths, calm down, and curb my need for speed. I\u2019ve even tattooed the reminder on myself. ;)\nWhat's next for you?\nI\u2019m just finishing work on my latest novel and getting ready to send it to Compass Talent for review. This latest book is very different from RIPPLE in that it is less about romance (though there is still plenty in there!) and more about socio-political issues in the U.S., but I hope it is as well received.. She lives in Rochester Hills, MI, with her husband, two boys, and more pets than anyone should ever own.\nTwitter:\nComing up on The Mitten blog: the conclusion of Dawne Webber's Beyond the Book series, a new 3 part craft series on developing voice, an interview with Buffy the Poetry Slayer, Ask Frida Pennabook, and another round of Hugs and Hurrahs.

    "context": "Ever since I tried it at a recent beer event I\u2019ve been obsessed by the humble radler. What is it you ask? A radler, is a low alcohol beverage made 50/50 of lager or pilsner and sparkling lemonade. After a quick google search i found it dates back to 1912 and originates from Germany. However, as the story goes it was created by an Inn Keeper in 1922, Franz Xaver Kugler, who realised he didn\u2019t have enough beer to serve to his regulars who were cyclists. He mixed his remaining beer stock with fresh citrus lemonade and they loved it. Probably for the same reason I do, its thirst quenching ability.\nThis type of drink is more commonly known here in Ireland as a Shandy. Growing up I remember my Father drinking this. To this day my Father in law would be a fan of it. Our version would be half a pint of Heineken or Carlsberg mixed with 7up.\nThe beer event I mentioned was an introduction to an Austrian Brewery, Stiegl , that are being imported by O\u2019 Haras. You can read more about that here thanks to SimonSaysBeer. I fell in love with their grapefruit radler. It was so full of flavour and so easy to drink at 2% abv. I\u2019ve been hoping we\u2019d see more of this by now.\nMore recently, on a shopping trip to Lidl I noticed they sell Perlenbacher in cans and bottles. We purchased a few to see what it would be like. We were pleasantly surprised. It was light and refreshing with a zingy lemon punch to it. My Sister happened to visit and I gave her some to try and she enjoyed it too. Since then I\u2019ve been hunting down a grapefruit one. It wasn\u2019t until Wayne mentioned it, that i made my own! He found this recipe and off I went.\nI had all the ingredients already so I was set. The first step was to make the fresh grapefruit soda:\n- Juice one whole grapefruit (room temperature) pour into a seal-able container and refrigerate.\n- Cut up juiced rind into chunks, place in a large plastic mixing bowl, add sugar and cover tightly with clingfilm.\n- Let this stand at room temperature stirring every 45 minutes until sugar is dissolved. I\u2019d plenty of time so i did this over 4 hours. You can leave it up to 12 if you prefer. I didn\u2019t start it early enough for that.\n- Measure reserved grapefruit juice, and juice remaining grapefruits to get 300 ml\n- Add to sugar mixture with lemon juice and mix well\n- Strain through a fine mesh strainer or piece of muslin cloth into a glass container. this can be stored for up to a week.\nI of course didn\u2019t wait that long and used it immediately. It was a hot sunny Sunday after all and we were thirsty. So to make the radler:\n- When ready to serve, add soda water to the fresh grapefruit syrup. Adjust to taste. I made mine quite tart.\n- For each radler add your chosen beer to a glass and mix with the grapefruit soda. I served mine in a pint glass.\nIt was great fun experimenting with this recipe. I had two different styles to work with. The first was Cotton Ball Brewing Mayfield 5 lager. This working incredibly well. The lager is really refreshing and crisp and carried the grapefruit syrup really well. The oohs and the gasps from Wayne confirmed it was indeed a success. The second was a bottle of Stiegl wheat beer. This was still nice but lacked the refreshing thirst quenching character of the lager. Have a go yourself and see what you come up with.\nOne Comment Add yours\nNice experimenting Janice! You would have absolutely loved the Radler variety in Germany. Although we\u2019re not huge fans of the Radler, it\u2019s definitely great to drink every once in a while on a sunny day! \ud83c\udf7b",

    "context": "Communication, relationships are key for ASU women's tennis athletic trainer\nJohn Teasley joined the program in 2015 as a graduate assistant\nGrowing up around both sports and medicine, John Teasley loves the job that now allows him to combine both: ASU women's tennis athletic trainer.\nTeasley said his mom worked in a hospital. As a kid, science and medicine intrigued him, but he also loved to play sports. Out of high school, he made the wrestling and golf teams, but Teasley\u2019s playing career ended before it really could get started.\n\u201cDuring my freshman year of high school, I tore my meniscus in my right knee and had to have surgery,\u201d Teasley said. \u201cI saw the athletic trainer and that is where I found the job that combines sports and medicine. It is funny because that is the typical story of how many athletic trainers got into the job.\u201d\nWhile he misses playing sports, Teasley said he was never the best golfer or wrestler, but he understood both sports. He also has a solid understanding of tennis that helps him dissect why a player cramps up after hitting a certain shot.\nTeasley said he loves helping athletes get back out on the court after an injury, something he's done extensively with ASU women's tennis. This makes the day-to-day grind of guiding players through rehab worth it. Currently, Teasley is helping senior Kassidy Jump work back from a right knee injury.\nJump says she is feeling better. Coach McInerney expects her to play against Arizona on Saturday. @statepresssport pic.twitter.com/AWIKHIb35M\u2014 Joe Jacquez (@joejacquezaz) April 19, 2017\n\u201cAt the end of the day, that is why I do this job,\u201d Teasley said. \u201cTo see somebody that has an injury not be able to play the sport that they love, work with them through the rehab, because everybody hates rehab and nobody has fun with that. But, to see them go through it and then see them play just as good as they were before, that makes me happy.\u201d\nTeasley was first exposed to athletic training as an undergrad for three years at Michigan State. During his senior year as a Spartan, Teasley applied for a variety of graduate internship programs.\nIn November 2014, Teasley applied to ASU. After the application process concluded, he interviewed with the tennis coaching staff. Before graduating from Michigan State in May 2015, Teasley accepted a full-time graduate assistant position at ASU.\nThe Michigan native knew he wanted to get away from the snow, and ASU women\u2019s tennis was looking for a new athletic trainer.\n\u201cThe weather played a huge part,\u201d Teasley said. \u201cFor 23 years, I was in the snow and I was like \u2018forget that\u2019 so I decided to come to the desert.\u201d\nTeasley realized early on that effective communication would make the job easier at ASU. On a daily basis, he has to talk with players, coaches, doctors and administrators about how all six players are feeling.\n\u201cHe (Teasley) knows how the kids are feeling and a way to get it out of them,\u201d head coach Sheila McInerney said. \u201cHe travels with us on the road and that is really helpful for a coach. It takes some of the pressure off us, as far of who can go and who can\u2019t go.\"\nAs an athletic trainer, he does not officially diagnosis injuries, but he can provide an opinion to the coaching staff. McInerney needs to know the status of an injured player because that effects practice plans and the lineup for singles and doubles.\n\u201cSheila wants the facts and she wants it right away,\u201d Teasley said. \u201cSo it is about how do I go about that and tell her in a way that makes the most sense.\u201d\nWhen a player is injured, Teasley is required to go to the doctor\u2019s office for the medical examination. Part of his job is to explain to players what the doctor\u2019s diagnosis means and how long they will be out. Teasley's great relationships with all the players helps ease this stressful process.\n\u201cThere is a lot of times where they come out of those appointments and say to me \u2018so, what is going on?'\u201d Teasley said. \u201cFor doctors, the medical terminology is just second nature.\u201d\nEarlier this season, sophomore Sammi Hampton reinjured her shin at the Texas Tech Invitational. During her doctor\u2019s appointment, Hampton said Teasley did a great job of explaining the injury and what the recovery process would entail.\nFrom day one, Teasley wanted every player to feel comfortable in his training room. When Hampton was rehabbing, he started with lighter conversations about her weekend or classes. Teasley said this helped put Hampton in a better mood and allowed him to ask about her injury.\nHampton said he has always had her back. She said he texted her every day to check in on her injury and kept her company while she was sitting out.\n\"You want someone that is going to be there for everything, not just your injuries,\" Hampton said. \"He knows when something is wrong, even if it isn\u2019t about tennis and will talk with you about it and that helps me play better.\u201d\nTeasley will finish his graduate assistant program after the season ends. If a full-time position opens up, he said he would take it in a heartbeat.\n\u201cI get paid whether we win or lose,\u201d Teasley said. \u201cI am not here for that. I am here to make sure that the athletes are safe and healthy and at the same time, doing what we can to get them on the court to play because that is what they want.\"\nReach the reporter at jpjacqu1@asu.edu or follow @joejacquezaz on Twitter.\nLike State Press Sports on Facebook and follow @statepresssport on Twitter.",

Drain the fruit (reserving the brandy) and heat up the oven to 150\u00baC (300\u00baF, gas mark 2). Butter and line with greaseproof paper the sides and base of a 23cm (9in) round cake tin.\n- Cream the butter and sugar jointly, then slowly beat in the eggs. Fold in the flour and spices, and then the reserved brandy. Put the dried fruit, peel, cherries, nuts, lemon zest and juice and fold jointly. Move to the tin and level the surface with a spoon.\n- Cover the top with a circle of greaseproof paper and bake for 2\u00bd-3 hours, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Leave the tin to make it chilly, then turn out onto a wire rack and pour over half of the remaining brandy. Leave for some minutes, and then pour over the rest of the brandy, wrap in cling film and store in a cold, dry place, ready to be iced for Christmas.\n- In the meantime, make the topping. Brush the cake with apricot jam. Knead the marzipan until soft, and then roll out onto a surface calmly dusted with icing sugar to around a little bigger than the top and sides of the cake. Lift the marzipan over the cake and smooth the top and sides. Rub in circular movements to give a clean end. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess marzipan from the base, and then mold the trimmings to make a mound for the top of the cake. Secure it with a little of the apricot jam, and then leave to dry for half a day.\n- Make up the royal icing with glycerin and water, according to the packet instructions. Utilizing a palette knife spread the icing in a thick layer of the whole cake. Make peaks, using the back of a teaspoon, so that the frosting looks like snow. Leave to dry.

    "context": "Fast Track\nThe long wait for Lebanon's public data network to go live could be over by the end of this year, allowing the country to open a new chapter in its ICT development.\n|~|airport-test-1.gif|~||~|All eyes have been on the mobile sector in Lebanon recently, and the tortuous process of re-vitalising the country\u2019s two troubled GSM networks. But 2005 should also see the long-awaited development of high-speed internet services moving up the country\u2019s agenda. Broadband subscriptions via DSL have yet to be made available for Lebanese users while the capacity of the country\u2019s public switched telephony network (PSTN) remains stretched. A public data network (PDN) that would take the pressure of the PSTN and support broadband has also yet to be pushed through, despite originally being scheduled for tender in 2001. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Telecoms (MoT) says the PDN, costing an estimated US$20million, will be tendered this month and could be up and running by the end of the year. \u201c[The PDN] is no longer a project of the mind,\u201d says Naji Andraos, director general for equipment and construction at the MoT. \u201cThis has been talked about for two years but it will be tendered in February. We hope that it will go into action by the end of 2005,\u201d he adds. The PDN is expected to have numerous benefits for Lebanon\u2019s telecoms sector, if and when it is launched. One will be to allow fixed line operator, Ogero, to offload data traffic from the PSTN and give it spare capacity to lease to ISPs. The MoT claims that IP traffic generated in Lebanon has been doubling annually in the last few years. It intends the PDN to have two internet gateways, an IP/MPLS core, eight remote access servers (RAS) and 20 digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs), to initally support data being generated from up to 3000 DSL customers. To prepare for the move, a node to connect local ISPs has already been established. 90Mbits/s of international capacity has also already been sourced, with half linking Lebanon to Europe and half to the US. \u201cThe PSTN has had limited manufacture and maintenance support,\u201d says Andraos. \u201cThere is big pressure [on] the MoT and Ogero to migrate the network to launch internet and IP services. We have a huge demand for broadband but we have not been able to satisfy [it],\u201d he adds. The MoT also says that the network will allow service providers to offer enhanced internet protocol (IP) services, such IP virtual private networks (VPNs) and packet telephony. But observers expect it to have an impact on elemental broadband services first, considering the sector\u2019s current under-development. \u201cThe PDN will mainly help the MoT introduce broadband services \u2014 it still hasn\u2019t introduced DSL,\u201d says Sami Sunna, senior research analyst at Arab Advisors. \u201cLebanon was expected to be a technological leader in the region but the situation in the telecoms sector has been chaotic, because of liberalisation and privatisation being slow. Many ISPs still get their connectivity through satellite as Ogero hasn\u2019t had enough bandwidth. Also, many wireless providers have been operating without being regulated,\u201d he adds. The government also intends to use the move to expand and develop its PSTN this year, which reportedly covered 95% of the country and had 750,000 subscribers at the end of 2004. According to Andraos, another project will see 40,000 payphones installed across Lebanon during 2005, while ISDN connections are expected to be in place in some rural areas by the middle of the year. Alcatel, Siemens and Ericsson have also been upgrading the country\u2019s PSTN switches \u2014 which again will be finished by mid-2005, he adds. This, the MoT hopes, will stabilise the fixed network, which has been losing customers to the country\u2019s two mobile networks. \u201cThe PSTN network was completely rebuilt after the civil war, and most of the lines are digital, but traffic has been going down for quite a while, as people are using their mobile phones instead of fixed lines,\u201d says Sunna. On a wider scope, the development of broadband in Lebanon also represents one of the key goals set out by the Telecoms Regulatory Authority (TRA) which is due to be up and running in Lebanon in the first half of this year. As such, the following monhts is also likely to see the broadband market being restructured. Once it is formed, the regulator is set to issue new licences to Lebanon\u2019s existing ISPs and datacomm operators, and oversee the restructuring of Ogero and its re-branding as Liban Telecom. Looking further down the line, it has also prepared a five year plan which could potentially see the creation of three, privately-owned national infrastructure operators competing to sell services across any technology to indirect service providers and end-users. Considering the country\u2019s track record, though, the question is whether all the reforms and investments planned for this year will come to fruition. But Androas is optimistic. \u201cThe MoT is taking a major step in its life,\u201d he points out. \u201cWe are moving from a state monopoly into a deregulated environment. We will see the TRA created \u2014 I hope \u2014 in the first months of 2005, [and] the creation of Liban Telecom. 2005 will be the year of the deregulation of Lebanese telecoms,\u201d he adds.||**||\n- JOIN THE DISCUSSION\n- Add Yours",

    "context": "A husband and wife with three kids suffer a tragedy from which they can't recover. Eventually they divorce. Years later the two run into each other on a street in the town by the sea they once called home. This is the scene in Manchester by the Sea that had moviegoers talking last year. The scene is maybe four minutes long, but in this halting, stuttering, soul-baring conversation between two bereaved people on the street, time seems to stop. They\u2019re still drowning in what happened to their family.\nYou\u2019ll have to see for yourself what happened to this couple played with resonant authenticity by Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. You'll see the movie isn\u2019t about their relationship. It\u2019s about Affleck as the ex-husband, alone and adrift on a sea of grief. The death of his older brother brings him back to Manchester for his teenage nephew. In the process of planning the funeral and becoming his nephew\u2019s legal guardian, the past intrudes on the present (as does a bit of humor), culminating with Affleck and Williams\u2019 reunion. With its intrusive flashbacks, character-driven plot and realistic dialogue, the film has the build of literary fiction. At first I assumed it was based on a book, and could I borrow this book from the Library? I\u2019d like to read it!\nAlas, there is no book. Manchester by the Sea is based on an original screenplay by its director Kenneth Lonergan. That it was written directly for the screen without bookish source material goes against the tide of Hollywood storytelling. As film industry analyst Stephen Follows reports: from 2005 to 2014, 61 percent of Hollywood\u2019s 1000 highest grossing movies were not original stories. They were adaptations, sequels, spin-offs, remakes or other types of derivative work. Today nary a month passes without some book-to-movie adaptation hitting theaters. (See: the Marvel movies.) Suffice it to say, we\u2019re swimming in movies based on books. Which is good! But...\nWhat if we reversed the tide and made a book based on a movie? This is not a novel idea. It\u2019s a novelization. The marketing synergies behind popular films often publish product tie-ins such as movie novelizations (TV shows get them, too). There are over 200 at the Library and GoodReads lists more. Some I find questionable. Terminator Salvation: The Novel?\nA novelization I wouldn\u2019t question is Manchester by the Sea. Its subject matter is heavy, but it ultimately finds humor amid the heartbreak and depicts a modern American man with psychological realism. A man of few words on screen, Affleck\u2019s character and, by extension, his indelible scene with Williams could be fleshed out with many words in a book I\u2019d want to read. The list below brings Manchester together with other movies based on original screenplays that could make binge-worthy books.\nFor years a meme has circulated on social media that perfectly sums up the difference between a movie experience and a book experience. Here it is. If you feel the same way and have seen a bookless movie you\u2019d like to experience as a read, tell us on Facebook @AustinLibrary, Twitter @AustinPublicLib or Instagram @AustinPublicLibrary. Let\u2019s ask the universe to adapt these movies into books we want to read.",

    "context": "(originally posted April 27, 2011)\nGood thing the Jays bats came alive last night, otherwise I\u2019d be looking about as grim as Pit Martin does on this card. It\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t have any money riding on any of last night\u2019s hockey games. I\u2019d have been 0-fer.\nI said a long time back that I wanted to go through the \u201964-65 Topps set. The thing that has been holding me back has been Pit Martin. I just don\u2019t know what to make of that expression on his face. There\u2019s no apparent reason for it. Pit, at the time of this card\u2019s printing, had just completed a pretty credible rookie season for Detroit, who went all the way to the Stanley Cup Final. His offensive totals weren\u2019t huge, just 9 goals and 21 points in 50 games, but when you consider he was a centre playing behind the likes of Alex Delvecchio and Norm Ullman, ice time would have been at a premium.\nA little guy with wheels, he\u2019d go on to an 18-year career (well, 17 if you leave out his cup of coffee in 1961) in which he\u2019d play in three Stanley Cup Finals, win the 1970 Masterton, take part in four All-Star games and just be a really sound #2 centre, scoring 30 goals three times and topping out at 90 points in \u201972-73. He\u2019d put in over 1100 games, 324 goals, 800-odd points. These are very good numbers, the totals of a very solid pro. Everything about Pit is upside, yet he looks oddly haunted.\nOf course, Pit Martin was also famous as the player who went the other way in one of the most lopsided trades in hockey history. It certainly wasn\u2019t Pit\u2019s fault. It was Terry Sawchuk\u2019s \u2013 and beer\u2019s.\nThe 1966-67 Chicago Black Hawks (as they were then commonly spelled) were the top team in hockey. They finished in first, seventeen points better than anyone. They scored more goals than anyone. They gave up fewer. They had the scoring leader, the league MVP, four of the six First-Team All-Stars and one of the Second-Team. They were the odds-on favourite to win the Stanley Cup. Unfortunately, in the playoffs they drew an experienced Leafs team that could check anything to death and had Terry Sawchuk in goal. Terry was lights out and took anything the Hawks could throw at him. Toronto eliminated Chicago in six games, en route to a Cup win.\nAfter their season ended, a young Black Hawk named Phil Esposito had a couple of pops at a team party and decided to give the GM a few suggestions about how best to handle the team in the off-season \u2013 specifically how not to screw everything up. This went over about as well as one would expect.\nDespite showing a fair amount of promise, Phil found himself shipped off less than a month later to the worst team in hockey \u2013 the Boston Bruins. With him came a pair of underperforming kids named Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield. In return came Pit Martin (traded to Boston in Dec. \u201965), a young banger of a defenseman named Gilles Marotte and a minor-league goalie named Jack Norris.\nThe trade wasn\u2019t really so much a bad one for Chicago as it was spectacular for Boston. Pit Martin was a very, very solid performer for the next ten years, while Marotte found some good offensive upside in Chicago before being shipped out in a trade to LA.\nEspo, on the other hand, combined with a sophomore defenseman named Bobby Orr and immmediately became the dominant centre in hockey. He became the first player to reach 100 points in a season and set scoring records that were unsurpassed until a kid named Gretzky arrived. He led the league in scoring 5 times between 1969 and 1974, was the First-Team All-Star every year between 1969 and 1974, second-team in \u201968 and \u201975. He would retire as hockey\u2019s second-leading scorer of all-time.\nAs for the other kids, Ken Hodge immediately became a constant 40-goal threat who hit 50 once. Stanfield became a dependable 20+ goal scorer and depth guy. Boston, dead last in 1966-67, became a powerhouse that won championships in 1970 and 1972 and probably would have won more had Orr been blessed with something other than kindling as knees.\nNone of this was Pit Martin\u2019s fault, but how do you live up to a trade like that? Maybe that\u2019s why he looks so glum.\nHe obviously gets over it, because he\u2019s smiling on all the rest of his cards.\nSadly, Pit died in a snowmobiling accident in 2008.",

    "context": "You are here: Home > Support > Sentry Spelling Checker Engine > License key overflow\nProduct: Sentry Spelling Checker Engine Windows SDK\nProblems:\nThe programming language I use doesn't support hexadecimal constants.\nHow can I convert the license key you provided to decimal?\nSolution:\nTo convert your license key to decimal:\nThe license key provided by Wintertree Software is expressed as a hexadecimal constant. The reason is the license key is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and most common programming languages (Visual Basic, C/C++/C#, Delphi) know to treat a hexadecimal constant as an unsigned integer. Some programming languages (e.g., PowerBuilder) do not support hexadecimal constants, so the license key provided by Wintertree Software must be converted to decimal.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use the Windows calculator utility in \"scientific\" mode. The calculator utility is found in the Accessories folder in the Start menu. To enable \"scientific\" mode, select View + Scientific. To convert your hexadecimal license key to decimal, follow these steps:\nMake sure the \"Hex\" radio button is selected. Note that a row of buttons labeled \"A\" - \"F\" near the numeric keypad in the calculator window becomes enabled.\nEnter your hexadecimal license key (e.g., 1234ABCD). Use the \"A\" - \"F\" buttons to enter any letters in your hexadecimal license key.\nSelect the \"Dec\" radio button. Your license key in decimal (e.g., 305441741) appears in the calculator's display.\nIf your license key overflows:\nThe license key is an unsigned integer. Roughly speaking, this means it uses all 32 bits of a 32-bit integer. A signed 32-bit integer, on the other hand, uses one bit to represent the sign, and the other 31 bits to represent the value. The largest positive signed value that can be represented in a 32-bit integer is 2147483647 decimal (7FFFFFFF hexadecimal). A decimal value larger than this may cause an overflow. If your hexadecimal license key is 8 digits long and starts with 8, 9, or A-F, it will convert to a large unsigned decimal integer that may cause an overflow. If your hexadecimal license key is fewer than 8 digits long, or starts with 0-7, it will not cause an overflow when converted to decimal (provided it is stored or passed as a 32-bit integer and not a 16-bit integer).\nIf your programming language supports unsigned decimal constants, you can probably avoid the overflow by indicating that the license key is unsigned. For example, in languages derived from C, an unsigned constant is indicated with the suffix \"U\", so a large integer is indicated as unsigned like this: 2882343476U. Consult your programming language's documentation, or contact the people who support it, to enquire about unsigned decimal constants.\nIf your programming language does not support unsigned decimal constants, you can convert a large unsigned decimal integer to a signed, negative decimal integer by subtracting 4294967296. For example, suppose your license key is ABCD1234 hexadecimal:\nConverted to decimal (see above) results in 2882343476\n2882343476 - 4294967296 = -1412623820\nThis negative value (-1412623820) will not cause an overflow (provided it is stored or passed as a 32-bit integer and not a 16-bit integer). Make sure you include the minus sign!",

    "context": "From the Covered California home page,. Those outside California, see healthcare.gov, the national site.\nWhen you start looking into it, the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) actually seems fairly straightforward and not that complicated. In a recent presentation sponsored by California Lawyers for the Arts, someone from the Actors Fund gave a clear summary of the program\u2019s benefits and who is affected. The Actors Fund got a grant to help with patient education, and they, along with the Affordable Care Act itself, are available for telephone assistance.\nIn California, the Affordable Care Act is implemented as something called Covered California. (They neglected to reserve the coverecalifornia.com website, so its coveredCA.com.) Apparently, California is one of the most prepared states in the country for Obamacare. Also in California, acupuncture is covered by some of the plans.\nPolicies for nearly everyone across the country with individual insurance or Medicare will now have ten essential benefits included in their policies, including both outpatient and emergency services, free physicals, maternity and newborn care, MENTAL HEALTH and substance-use programs, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services and devices, preventive and wellness services, pediatric oral and vision, coverage of preexisting conditions, and certain preventive free tests and procedures. Self-insured and group/employer plans are not covered and many group/employer plans are allowed to grandfather in their benefits or lack thereof, as long as they don\u2019t change the benefits. But no ACA plan can exist that doesn\u2019t also exist in the private sector.\nIf you are 65 or older, you can\u2019t be on an Affordable Care Act plan, you have to be on Medicare (or you can be on Medicaid/Medi-Cal if you make less than $15,414 a year). However, most Medicare recipients making less than $85,000 a year have already been eligible for reduced prescription costs as part of the plan. And those who have Part B of Medicare (the medical coverage beyond purely in-patient hospital coverage) also get the ten essential benefits.\nAnd Medi-Cal is now available to anyone of any age based on income. (You used to have to have a child or one on the way.) Again, California has taken advantage of the Medicaid part of the Federal program. Some states have initially decided not to help their poor through this program. And some states are intentionally not educating their citizens about the program. But, again, California is making a strong effort in this area.\nIf your employer already offers insurance you have to take that, unless it amounts to more than 9.5% of your income, then you can take a Covered California plan, which lets you get assistance if you\u2019re eligible (which many individuals and especially families are). Some companies, like Trader Joe, are discontinuing their employee coverage, thinking that employees will get a better deal on their own, since ACA premium assistance comes with income levels below $45,960 a year. In fact, the government\u2019s assistance to help pay the insurance premiums can be quite high. You can go to CoveredCA.com and navigate to a calculator that will tell you how much assistance you will get, if any, and what plans are available to you.\nThere are four levels of insurance plans you can choose from\u2014bronze, silver, gold, and platinum\u2014the more precious the metal, the higher the percentage of medical expenses covered by the plan/the lower the co-pay, and also the higher the premiums are. But all plans have the free prevention items, like free yearly checkups, blood pressure checks, vaccinations, and even stop-smoking programs. Mental health coverage will be a major new benefit for many.\nThere are 13 insurance companies you can go with in California, and of those, six serve L.A. County. When you are comparing plans on the Covered California site, the current site shows only four companies in a row, so look to see if there are more to the right. (When I viewed it, dots below the boxes showed if there were more plans to look at, and seemed easy to miss. But the site may look different as they refine it. It\u2019s all new!)\nDuring the first year, the amount of assistance you can get with premium payments is determined by your 2012 taxes. But if your income changes at any point, you just tell Covered California and they adjust. The Actors Fund kept emphasizing that the program is very consumer-oriented.\nThe initial enrollment period this year is Oct. 1, 2013 \u2013 March 31, 2014. If you enroll before Dec. 15, coverage starts Jan 1, 2014. After this year, the yearly enrollment period will be Oct. 15-Dec. 7.\nThere is a single total penalty of $95 for the year or 1% of your income for not enrolling the first year, $325/2% the next year, and $695/2.5% per year beyond that. And adults under 30 (\u201cthe invincibles\u201d) can choose a catastrophic plan if they want to.\nFor assistance, questions, and information, you can call Covered California at 800-300-1506, go into an office (soon), or go online. You can also call the Actors Fund Covered California helpline, at 855-491-3357. The Artists Health Insurance Resource Center, at Ahirc.org, gives information about provisions that directly impact artists and entertainers.\nA representative at Covered California said they were interested in making the system better as they go, and he said they were open to feedback.\nFor your interest, there is a fascinating article, called \u201cTesting, Testing,\u201d that appeared in the Dec. 14, 2009, New Yorker, that compares health-care reform to the reform of the U.S. agriculture system at the start of the 20th century, a comparison the article\u2019s author finds hopeful. As part of that hope, he peers into some of the pilot programs that were tucked into the bill.

On the back of the form ALL companies that are controlled, or owned, by Merck share information.\nThis means that if MERCK now has on record my complete Military Record and Medical Records. At will this German (Bohemia) company could literally disable my dog and break into my house.\nA little History - MERCK was started in Germany in 1668 in Germany selling herbs.\nIn 1941 MERCK was seized by the NAZIs and continues to be owned by the German Government - although it is on the Stock Market. It's Corporate Sales of MERCK KGaE are around $30 Billion/yr and its MERCK subsidiary around $48 Billion per year.\nTotal MERCK sales of all subsidiaries run over $100 Billion Dollars per year.\n----\nMERCK'S DIABETES CONSPIRACY\nSo here is how this little Diabetes Conspiracy works:\nAlloxen is made by MERCK.\nAlloxen is used in White Bread to help \"Whiten\" up the flour. This little chemical is actually formed in small quantities when one eats the NEW GMO wheat and eats high levels 0of Chlorine found in drinking water.\nAlloxen mixes with NEW Wheat Protein and forms a chemical that kills Beta cells in your Pancreas and thus induces Diabetes and makes YOU fat.\nIn fact - if one wished to induce diabetes in lab rats Alloxen is feed to these rats so new Diabetes drugs may be tested.\nAfter MERCK started putting Alloxen in wheat they also began producing a drug called \"Metformin.\" This drug reduced blood sugar levels caused by diabetes, makes you stupid and dissolves your muscles.\nShortly after that MERCK began selling Lisinopril - a drug that stops the High Blood Sugar Levels caused by their Alloxen form destroying your liver,\nBoth Metformin and Lisinoprin cause Heart, Liver and Kidney problems which are solved by another batch of MERCK drugs.\nIn other words - these Bohemian NAZIs not only create a disease they come out with the drug that makes you stupid and kills you to counter the effects of the disease they created.\nFolks - we lost WW2 because we fell asleep after the war - yet these NAZIs just kept on going.\nSo what does the IMF Owned Corporation called the FDA think?\nThey hire MERCK employees in droves - so what do you think.\nIt is Treason at the top and the Joint chiefs of COWARDS and not going to stop it. Their Commander has Erectile Dis-function and the Chief of the US Marines has a hurt hip. They are worthless to stop this treason.\n-------------------\nDoes the conspiracy end there - I think not.\nWell - it appears that Alloxen is also used to make White Rice Noodles all around the world. Apparently what goes in White Rice is not pure rice --- it is a myriad of rotten wheat and pother grains that are bleached.\nSo you go Gluten Free only to find not only wheat but Alloxen in these Rice and Bean noodles and the FDA turns a deaf ear to this so they can be re-hired by MERCK if needed.\nOne happy family of fat stupid people running the world - but they are powerful and will continue to be so until GOD pulls the plug.\n-----\nSo what do you do?\n1) First - eat Organic. Natural means nothing. We just bought some \"Natural\" Crandbaries that smell like Diesel.\n2) Second - Eat it if you can see what is in it. Do not eat Rice Noodles - eat rice.\n3) Buy a Rice Cooker and eat allot of rice. Make sure you wash the Fungicide off first and if you need to store it long term mix it with Diatamatious Earth so you do not get worms.\n4) Eat Spelt Bread (Famous Dave's) and Non-Gluten Breads.\n5) If you buy a vitamin buy one made of Whole Foods. Since the FDA Corporation owns the term \"Organic\" they can allow deadly chemicals to be added to any food claiming to be Organic so shop carefully.\nMany of the Chemical Created Vitamins do not contain exactly what is in the labels - especially ones made in China.\n6) Vote for, and demand, budget reductions all across the board in the US Corporation and other US based Corporations like the FDA. They are not here to help you - they are from the Government and none of these \"Corporate Freaks\" are welcome in this Ambassador's House.\n-----------\nSo there you have it - a company that creates a disease purposely and then make the products to help alleviate the pain they create - a company based in, and seized by in 1941. the NAZI Homeland - Bohemia.\nCan we Zeig Heil yet?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor You Intel Geeks:\nDid not GOD tell you that within a Fortnight last Friday on the Radio:\nGOD is never wrong.\nWatch what comes next - within another Fortnight.\n---\nRussia - Olympics - I live in the wrong area to do this - catacomes under the stadium?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Pray that MERCK goes away.\nYou heard this one first here on APFN\nDr William B.

And if you're a fan of Sleek's blushes, you'll know that they're very pigmented. Luckily this blush is incredibly sheer so instead of looking like patches of you are turning into an orange, you'll just have a nice subtle glow about you.\nI use a Real Techniques Blush brush to apply it, which is perhaps not ideal. I find the brush brilliant for working with blushes which are very pigmented, because it doesn't pick up too much product, and blends nicely. As this is very sheer however, you have to put a little more effort in. This works for me though, because I use this blush when I want to look like I haven't got any on, but magically have a peachy flush to my cheeks. How sly.\nWhile I think the colour of this would look beautiful on darker skin tones, I don't think the colour pay off is great enough. While this shows up subtly on my pale skin, I think women who are darker would really struggle to have this show up at all, which is a shame because as I said, I think the colour in the pan would look beautiful on darker skin.\nI can't believe this is my first peach blush. While all of my pinks will always have a place in my heart, I think 'Life's a Peach' will have a place on my face for the foreseeable future.\nAvailable at Superdrug for \u00a34.29\nThank you for taking the time out of your day to read and comment on my little old blog.

    "context": "In response to something I wrote about the Don Imus saga Friday, Matt, a journalism graduate school friend of mine, replied and made his case quite succinctly. Another friend, Karl, weighed in, as did I. With our back-and-forth in mind, I'd like to add some detail to my point-of-view. If I may make so bold, Matt's entire argument can be summarized in his own words: \"By calling for (and ultimately causing) the firing of Don Imus, it sets a bad precedent for free speech.\" I disagree, and, though I am as firm a defender of free speech as he, I would like to take this argument in a different direction, speaking to both the issues of our freedoms and the role of the people-powered movement in the debate.\nBefore I do that, however, I'd like to address another of Matt's central assertions, the importance of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson in determining Imus's eventual fate. Matt wrote, \"What happened here was a vast minority of people took full use of the media resources around them (in this case, Rev. Al and Jesse Jackson) and created a situation where there was a perceived national outcry against this particular discussion. Advertisers and corporate executives were pressured into firing Imus lest they be subject to continued protesting outside of their offices. In the face of this pressure, advertisers dropped out and corporate was forced to fire Imus.\" Quite simply, no.\nSharpton wasn't responsible for Imus's firing. Nor was Jackson. Nor was I. Don Imus was responsible for what happened to Don Imus. He said something both woefully stupid and incredibly bigoted, millions of people took note of the man's sad track record of similar statements, and they responded. What Imus-defenders may perceive as the start of the story - the response - only occurred because Imus so polluted the airwaves. The fault is clear: It begins and ends with Imus. Now, back to my point, about what I think is the collision between the old way of doing things and the new way of doing things. This intersection is especially apparent in the uproar surrounding Imus's statements.\nImus - and his many, many peers still gainfully employed (Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, for instance) - represent what I'll call \"active assholery\". In the past, active assholery was met only with what I'll call \"passive participation\" or, worse yet, nothing at all. In other words, people like Beck would enjoy free rein to pollute the airwaves with all manner of hate speech, while the rest of us had to sit there and take it. If you don't like my choice of phrase, why not use Matt's chosen frame, the free market model? There, our choice was easy: Listen, or don't. Take it, or ... take it. Even the most aggressive tools at our disposal were anything but.\nI'm not interested in capitalism winning out. I'm interested in democracy winning out. Expect the market to take care of people like Imus? If that's the case, the market has been doing a terrible, terrible job. In my model, on the other hand, active assholery meets active participation. When confronted with the Imuses and Becks of the world, we no longer have to take it. We can, and should, do something about it. And I fail to see why their rights to speak out trump ours. Referring to the Imus matter, Matt wrote, \"The way it was done, in my opinion, subverts that Constitution and opens up a whole different discussion about what free speech truly is.\" Not so. What would have subverted the Constitution would have been to embrace the old model, to do nothing. By taking back our rights, we actively embraced all that's good about that brilliant document.\nThinking about it through this frame, I see nothing at all wrong with contacting journalists, their employers or their corporate partners and voicing our concerns. How is that different from contacting our elected officials? Sure, the outcome may not be the same, but the intent often is: Seeking responsiveness and the awareness of a particular point-of-view. By likening what happened to Imus to what he believes could happen to me, Matt does a tremendous disservice to his argument. Why? Because, at the core, we're not talking about punishing speech with which people don't happen to agree. We're talking about fighting back against what has been a steady stream of hate speech. Matt's counterexample to the Imus firing - a coordinated right-wing response to my writings - falls flat because my criticisms of those whom the right-wingers admire never, ever wade into the use of flatly bigoted language.\nThese are the sort of traps we face on a near-daily basis: Contact an advertiser about a prominent media personality using bigoted language and we're taking part in a partisan witch hunt, but make legitimate criticisms of the Bush administration and face ouster simply because we said something with which conservatives disagree. See the problem? As a progressive, I've become used to being confronted regularly with these sort of false equivalencies. And when we're not being held subject to such scrutiny, we're being barraged with muddying arguments like those now being made about rappers' use of the word \"ho\". This is why, I'm sure, someone will accuse me of being a hypocrite for writing something like this in the past. You told people to change the channel. We're telling you to change the channel. What's the difference? But what I wrote about then - content with which one disagrees - bears no similarity to what I'm writing about now, truly bigoted content.\nWho, in the long run, will be more hurt by what Imus said - Imus, or the Rutgers women's basketball team? Certainly not Imus, who, after some time in civil society's penalty box, will surely be back, perhaps on satellite radio (and perhaps, due to the attention now being paid him, at an even higher pay grade). When that happens, there's nothing in Imus's history that tells us his contrition won't be short-lived. The team, meanwhile, will, no matter what heights the women reach in their lives, always face the stigma of being called \"nappy-headed hos\". This goes far beyond hurt feelings and, in doing so, beyond a simple First Amendment argument. Imus hasn't lost his freedom of speech, He's lost his job. His employers terminated him not because his actions posed a First Amendment crisis; they did so because his continued employment posed a bottom-line crisis. So, in that way, what happened was a victory for the market. And democracy.\nComment Preferences",

A reviewer on\nDespite these complaints, the design of many new coffee bars betrays a great deal of thought. The richly grained black-walnut counters of Caffetteria, a coffee bar that opened in SoHo in June, were milled from a single tree in upstate New York.

The first\nThe spread of coffeehouses coincided with the rise of the portable office, as growing numbers of people conducted their working lives with a laptop and wireless signal. By the early 1990s, Starbucks locations were averaging 1,600 square feet and offering a range of pastries, sandwiches and other food.\nSome coffee-bar owners say their tiny spaces and lower rents allow them to concentrate on what they do best. When Stumptown Coffee Roasters opens its second New York coffee bar next month, in Red Hook, Brooklyn, baristas there will be focused on brewed coffee to the exclusion of almost everything else, including espresso (see accompanying article). They would not have time \u2014 or space \u2014 to master six kinds of brewing gear, plus iced coffee, if they had to grill panini, too.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a proprietor and you\u2019re paying those rents, you need to augment your coffee with other products,\u201d said Kevin Cuddeback, the owner of Gimme!

    "context": "[PS3 JRPG Review] Pier Solar and the Great Architects | PS3Blog.net\n.\nBeing a turn-based RPG with state-of-the-art aesthetics, Pier Solar tells the epic story of Hoston, a young botanist who is on a quest to save his father from a mysterious illness. With 64MEG of mega-power at their hands, WaterMelon have given players innovative battles, fantastic graphics with background scaling, mini-games and plenty of other surprises that will mega-blast the player every time!\nPier Solar and the Great Architects is an ambitious project that was relatively recently released (in 2010) on the Sega Megadrive/Genesis, ten full years after the last official game release for this console. After its successful launch, it has been given a second life on the PS3 and PS4, and it will also release on the Vita (game is Cross-Buy between all platforms).\nPier Solar HD \u2013 E3 Trailer\nThis is a 16-bit game RPG where you start by following Hoston, Alina and Edessot, who are searching for a cure for Hoston\u2019s father. They soon find what they were looking for, but on their way back to the village after their dangerous excursion, Alina\u2019s father is very mad at her, and she then decides to leave town. Soon after, Hoston and Edessot go after her and thus their story begins.\nThe battle system in Pier Solar is similar to what we would expect from a 16-bit turn-based RPG, with its own specific features. For instance, some magic spells need to be buffed (by gathering) before being casted. Each \u201cgather\u201d raises the character\u2019s buff by one increment (and can go up to 5), and affects both his attack and magic power.\nAn automatic battle mode is available and can be used when you encounter weaker enemies, but it felt that the characters weren\u2019t very good at thinking by themselves. For instance, some characters would use up all their precious mana for unnecessary healing spells on almost full HP characters. There is an option in which you can select which kind of action is enabled for the Automatic battle, but even when the Spells options was disabled, it didn\u2019t stop them from using spells.\nIn the dungeons, the level design is a bit weird. A few dungeons have sections that are unreachable which led to unnecessary searching to get there, and are filled with small hidden paths that are hard to see on the default HD rendering mode (more on this later). Also, while being fairly acceptable, the random encounter rate of the game feels too high when we have to backtrack while looking for the path that leads to the end of the dungeon.\nFinally, apart from the unusual level design, there are some cryptic design choices in the story progression. For instance, in the second dungeon of the game, I reached the end and was greeted by a closed door. I searched, but there seemed to be nothing I could do to progress further, so after half an hour of research, I resorted to an online guide to see what I was doing wrong. Turns out, I had to talk around ten times to a guy from a zone I thought I had completed before he joined my party and unlocked the door of the dungeon. It would have been easier to determine if there had been an indication I needed that character to progress.\nGame engine and soundtrack\nOne of the strengths of Pier Solar and the Great Architects is how well the visual and game engines are done. The soundtrack is pretty good, and can be switched from 16-bits or remastered on-the-fly (I preferred the charm of the remastered one though!). Same goes for the rendering modes, which can be switched from 16-bit to HD and HD+. I preferred the HD modes, but like I mentioned earlier, the level design has a lot of hidden paths that appeared almost invisible on the HD mode. Because of this, I often needed to switch to 16-bits rendering in order to see the paths and get through a dungeon, and then back to HD once I found the way.\nFinal Thoughts\nPier Solar and the Great Architects is a good RPG that has a very fun battle system but a harder than usual dungeon exploration setting due to its level design and some cryptic progression choices. The ability to switch from 16-bits to HD modes for both the soundtrack and the graphics is a very nice feature that will definitely please RPG gamers.\nAlso, do keep in mind that this game is Cross-Buy between the PS3 and PS4 versions, and that a Vita version is coming soon!\nReview\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCost: $14.99\nPSN Game size: 2.2GB\nDisclaimer",

    "context": "To Moralize Or Not To Moralize\nSo, I run to '7-11' today and outside are not one but TWO homeless people.\nOne asked if I could spare a dollar. He was very specific--'A DOLLAR'--instead of the usual; 'Do you have any spare change I could have?'.\nThe other homeless man did not ask for anything nor even look my way.\nThe one that did was clean, shaved and didn't appear to be dirty.\nThe other man--the one who didn't approach me--was just the opposite: scruffy beard, dirty body and clothes.\nWith money being so tight on my end, I hesitated to even acknowledge the man who asked but I simply replied; \"I'll catch you on my way out\".\nI thought about complaining to the sales girl--how nice it would be to walk into any store these days and not be 'accosted'--but I held my tongue.\nNext to the cash register was cooked hot dogs for sale; two for $2.22.\nI could have just given each of the men a dollar, saved the twenty two cents, and be on my way. But then those age old questions comes into play--at least in my head;\n\"How responsible is it to give a homeless person money?\"\n\"What will they do with it--drugs? Alcohol? Cigarettes?\"\nSo, I bought them both a hot dog and in each of the cardboard containers the hot dogs came in I placed a packet of ketchup, mayo, relish, mustard and a napkin. I even thought about chips and a drink but...well, money and all--plus the moral dilemma swimming around in my head...\nSo, I gave them each their hot dog.\nBoth said 'thank you' and the one who didn't ask for anything even offered up a 'Have a good day'.\nI wondered at the oddness of it all on my way home and also wildly wondered if I was perhaps part of an experiment; \"The seemingly better dressed--and cleaner--of the two asks the customers for money (a specific amount, no less)...what will be the result? How will the customers react? What about the other man? Will he be acknowledged and rewarded? Or will he be 'punished' for being quiet and not asking? \"No food for you 'cause you didn't ask--just as well, saved me a buck...\"\nWas the one who approached me even homeless? Or just testing society?\nInteresting.\nThe extra twenty two cents was a cheap price to pay for my peace of mind.\nThen again, is it my place to moralize??? I figure, well, it's my money so, honestly my answer is yes.\nWhat's your thoughts? What would you have done?\nI think you did the right thing. I would have been thinking the same thing too . . .experiment? Either way . .you won out by doing a good deed. :)\nYou did excellent. You are so thoughtful. I wonder about giving money also. I guess I am a skeptic. It sure is heartbreaking to see so many people homeless now days. I think it is going to get much worse unfortunately. Thankfully there are wonderful people like you in the world. Even in your tight situation you still reached out to help.\nAll I could think of the entire time reading your story was something my grandma used to quote from the bible, it went something like...be careful how you treat strangers, for you might be entertaining angels unaware.\nI think you did a wonderful thing!\npeace\nDefinitely the right thing to do! If they were truly in need, that must have been such a blessing!\nJo, I'm so proud of you! I've been jaded on giving out anything to panhandlers. I once did the same thing you did only to have the person tell me that they didn't ask for food. They wanted the money. Can you believe that?!\nJo, if you get time then read my post \"height of imagination\" in the end i have narrated a real life experience, similar to yours.. and you will be surprised with the answer!\nI will try to help them through food, because its the first thing they might buy with the money so better feed them instead..\nyou did a gr8 job..\nhere's the link\nYou did the right thing... I had a similar experience a couple of years ago & you've just inspired me to post about it. I love that you are kind-hearted enough to spend your money on homeless people when times are difficult enough for you already. As they say in Australia, \"good on you!\"\nI would have done the same as you did. I couldn't have ignored the other man just 'coz he didn't ask for help.\nJo, I don't think it matters who the men were or what their status is, or even why they were there at the store. Your random act of kindness is the important part of the story. Humanity needs as many acts of kindness as it can get. Random or not. You not only helped those two men, you helped yourself.\nHi Jo,\nI totally agree with Kyle your random act of kindness is great we do need more of them.\nLove,\nHerrad\nI think you did a great thing. Most people would have totally avoided them even on the way out. You did a good thing.\nThere seems to be a lot of homeless in certain parts of the city I travel in. It is hard to know if they are alright or not. Once, a homeless guy had a sign that said, \"Its my moms birthday and she would like a beer.\" I happened to have just bought some beer, so I gave him one, the ran across the street and gave it to this old lady sitting under a tree, the mom I supposed. She smiled and waved and yelled thanks to me, so that was nice. I liked your story though, I would have done the same thing too.\nI have very vivid memories of a homeless man that always stood at my Mom's exit for work. His sign always asked for money, but at least a few times a week, my Mom would roll down her window and hand him some coffee or a biscuit or hotdog. She'd always think of him when she was getting her morning coffee, or stopping at McDonalds. You did the right thing.",

His mom, Tracy, had quit her job in the health care industry to live with him at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles as he endured treatments for nearly half the year.\nMoney was extremely tight. As the year wore on, Tracy, a single mom, worried not just about her young son\u2019s health, but also about meeting her family\u2019s basic needs.\nFor Nikki Katz, 2002 was also a watershed year. Her dear friend\u2019s godson had been diagnosed with pediatric cancer.\n\u201cIt was devastating, and I felt helpless,\u201d Katz said in a recent interview, \u201cand I wanted to help.\u201d\nWith that simple motivation, Katz founded Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering families that have a child, up to 21 years old, with cancer by providing them financial, emotional and educational support programs.\nKatz was in the process of getting the foundation\u2019s 501(c)3 nonprofit designation when, at a coffee shop one day in Ojai, she saw a cash jar at the counter seeking help for young Colby and his family, who were well loved in their tight-knit community.\nThat timely encounter led to Colby\u2019s family becoming the very first recipient of help from the Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation, which has gone on to help hundreds of children with cancer and their families in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.\nThe thousands of dollars the foundation provided to Colby and his family in 2002 allowed them to pay numerous bills and have a Christmas celebration.\nTeddy Bear Cancer Foundation Founder Nikki Katz with Colby Chapman and his fianc\u00e9 Katie and their baby girl Veda.\nPhoto contributed\nToday, Colby Chapman is a strapping 24-year-old working as a warehouse administrator in Carpinteria and living in Ojai with his fianc\u00e9e, Katie, and their baby girl, Veda.\nHis memories of the long months spent lying in a hospital bed, battling a disease he wasn\u2019t old enough to fully comprehend, have now faded. What Colby most remembers from back then is the love of Katz and everyone at Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation, and their genuine desire to help him and his family.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely shaped who I am today,\u201d Colby,\u201d he said.\nHis mom Tracy can also look back now on that trying time with a sense of gratitude.\n\u201cEven after he was no longer sick, Nikki always kept Colby involved in the foundation\u2019s events. It made it like a game for him,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cJuly marks the anniversary of his diagnosis, so that\u2019s always a sentimental month for us, but honestly, we also remember the laughter and the fun of that time.\u201d\nIn the 15 years since Nikki Katz founded Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation, it has provided more than $1.7 million in financial assistance. Over the years, thousands of community members have come together to help through the organization. This year, the foundation is celebrating its 15th anniversary with a Gold Ribbon Luncheon in October.\n\u201cThe foundation is way bigger than I ever thought it would be. I never thought in my wildest dreams it would get this big. I\u2019m very proud of what it\u2019s become in its first 15 years,\u201d Katz said.\nFor more information about the Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation, including ways to get involved, contact Executive Director Lindsey Leonard at lindsey@teddybearcancerfoundation.org or 805-563-4740.",

    "context": "Day 10 of the Author Blog Challenge: What was your research process?\nMore than likely, even the most prosaic of fiction books will require at least a modicum of research. Historical fiction probably requires scads of investigation.\nSailing into \u201cCocos Island Treasure,\u201d the first manuscript chosen for publication, I spent a LOT of time researching the internet, first discovering there really was such a place!\nThe journey has been fascinating because unfortunately he passed away before I could ever pick his brain about his youth; his sailing adventures, his mining or exploration adventures, or his actual birth location for that matter.\nI would have benefited hearing about all these exciting tropical locales wherein he apparently enjoyed some pearl diving as well as hunting for pirate treasures. As I recently posted regarding pirate treasures on Cocos Island, William Thompson purportedly loaded one of the largest pirate treasure troves aboard the Mary Dear in Peru in 1820. He and his crew killed the Spanish guards and buried the treasure said to be worth well over $160,000,000 (now known as \u201cThe Loot of Lima\u201d).\nEach book after that, because they are classified as historical fiction, mandated many, many hours of research, either because of the location of adventures, the names contained in the plots, or the procedures or practices of his day\u2013especially with his narration of the capture and rendering of whales.\nProbably the most time spent researching was the fourth book, \u201cHot Air Promotions,\u201d which involved the penny mining stocks of the twenties and thirties. It was HUGE! The language of the stock market, the mines, the business practices and papers, and the people\u2013how could you ever win? And I quote, \u201cWhen you win, you lose.\u201d\nThe most fun, however, in the examination of the chronicles of the mines was chasing down the locations\u2013many now ghost towns\u2013some still thriving with history reading stranger than fiction. You can\u2019t make this stuff up! I discovered that the University of Nevada, Reno, maintains a massive library containing the history of gold, silver, and mineral mines of the west\u2013where they gladly accepted a copy of the book. Goldfield, (NV) a former mining town, enjoys many a chilling ghost story that contains notorious names included in the book as well.\nThe odyssey has been a lesson in history: Of places, people, and practices. As the saying goes, \u201cThe more things change, the more they stay the same.\u201d\n4 thoughts on \u201cWhat Was The Research Process?\u201d\nI am a little mystified by this pingback 3 days ago, but appears to be generated in 2015? I see the photo of my mining cert on your page. So\u2026was there a question?\nThank you for the inquiry! As the article notes, I spent some lengthy time on the internet, placed Google Alerts for any additional new information, and in the case of the mining towns, actually walked the streets and talked to the people about the local folklore\u2013some of which was pretty fascinating (i.e., Goldfield NV in Hot Air Promotions). Additionally, I scanned other books where available to glean pertinent info. As I continued to get new information or pictures, I edited the book to add the new items in a newer edition of the book. You may notice Cocos Island, for instance, has had 4 editions as well as a change of cover (which is a photo of one of his original paintings). Going through all my granddad\u2019s writings, articles or pics he saved, his own paintings, or letters he wrote me in Victorian handwriting was an education in itself. I\u2019m still learning some of his sailing terms!",

It can leave a child with life-changing brain injuries and disabilities.\nThe first of these fundraising events is an awareness day at Sainsbury\u2019s Sheffield\u2019s Archer Road store, consisting of volunteers and supporters of the Eden Dora Trust helping customers to pack their shopping bags whilst raising awareness of childhood Encephalitis. This will take place this coming weekend (Friday 30 September and Saturday 1 October 2016).\nThe aim of the charity is to help make life better and easier for children and their families and carers affected through support, information, research and rehabilitation.\nThe Eden Dora Trust is the only charity in the UK dedicated solely to children who suffer from Encephalitis. Charity patrons include Louis Tomlinson, Paul Dickov, Joe Hart and Andrew \u2018Freddie\u2019 Flintoff.\nPetrina said: \u201cWe were very honoured and excited to be chosen as Sainsbury\u2019s charity partner of the year, and we are really looking forward to working together with Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\u201cCommunity is at the heart of everything we do as a charity so to be involved with such a community-focused organisation in a city as friendly and supportive as Sheffield is without doubt a huge boost.\n\u201cEden was very lucky to survive Encephalitis, when so many other children do not. There was nowhere near enough support available, and we knew that we needed to help others. We were adamant that other families and carers were not to go through this devastating illness alone, like we had to.\n\u201cVital funds raised from events such as those on Friday and Saturday will help pioneering research into the causes, diagnoses and treatments of this debilitating illness, produce educational literature, and provide training for families, teachers and health care professionals involved with the ongoing care and rehabilitation affected by this life-changing illness.\n\u201cIf anyone can spare any time at all to help, whether that\u2019s an hour or two, or the whole day, that would be be amazing.

(In fact, she didn't give him a chopper, the monarchy merely leased one for several members of the Royal Family to use.)\nIn any event, royal spending, whether in the U.K. or when the royals visit countries such as Canada, has always been a bit of a lightning rod.\nThe unusual aspect this time is that the controversies seem to be hitting William and Kate, two of the most popular young royals. They also may reveal some misconceptions around the complex nature of funding an institution that has an historic and, at times, controversial relationship with the taxpayer.\n\"There has always been public scrutiny of royal finances, and that tends to be cyclical,\" says Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal historian and blogger.\n\"In periods of recession, or periods when the monarchy is more unpopular, the royal finances receive more attention.\"\nAnd since the recession of 2008, she adds, there has been more scrutiny of all the royal families in Europe.\nWhirlybirds.\nAt the same time, however, a few cracks have appeared in their carefully constructed public persona.\n\"William and Kate aren't humble \u2014 they're a pair of spoiled kids wasting YOUR money,\" read one particularly pointed headline in the Daily Mirror recently.\nAs Harris sees it, there are several reasons behind the recent scrutiny of their finances, including the tabloid interest in trying to break through their wall of privacy.\nAnother, she says, is \"because there is still uncertainty about William's role.\n\"He was a search and rescue pilot, and then he was taking some time to devote to his philanthropic work regarding conservation, and now there's once again speculation back and forth \u2014 will he become a full-time member of the Royal Family, will he return to his work as a pilot, possibly as an air ambulance pilot?\"\nThat said, the reports he had received a helicopter for his birthday were off base, says Harris. Buckingham Palace, where aides insisted the leased machine would be used by several members of the Royal Family, said the chopper would provide \"good value for money,\" the Daily Telegraph reported.\nThe helicopter is a prime example of some of the misconceptions about royal finances, Harris says, noting \"that it was reported as an expensive birthday present for William, when the helicopter is being leased to assist a number of members of the Royal Family with their royal duties.\"\nThe actual cost and duration of the lease for the $11-million helicopter likely won't be known until next year's annual accounting. But the sum is coming out of what's called the sovereign grant, which some people, at least, say is taxpayer supported.\nThe cost of sovereignty\nExpenses that help members of the Royal Family carry out their duties come from the sovereign grant, a new lump sum arrangement that includes what was previously called the civil list.\nThat grant is currently set at 15 per cent of the net surplus income from Crown lands that were, in historic times, directly owned by the sovereign and are now administered by the British government. And in 2013/14, it amounted to \u00a336.1 million, or nearly $66 million Cdn.\n\"These sums are not infinite,\" says Harris.\n\"There have been reports that the renovations to Kensington Palace mean that repairs to Buckingham Palace will be delayed, so this is simply not a fund that can be constantly drawn on. It's a fixed percentage that the Queen receives each year towards the Royal Family carrying out its duties.\"\nIndeed, much attention was focused on reports earlier this year that the royal household spent more than it received from the sovereign grant in 2013, and covered the shortfall from a reserve that was down to its last million pounds.\nBut some observers sloughed off any suggestion of real money troubles at the Palace.\n\"The idea that Her Majesty is down to her last million quid makes for good headlines but the truth is far less dramatic,\" Harry Mount wrote in The Daily Telegraph.\n\"The gradual draw-down of that reserve was always the express intention of the royal household and the treasury. The reserve had been carefully squirrelled away by the household to deal with a period of royal austerity.\"\nRoyal expenditures include money from the sovereign grant. Separate from that are their private incomes.\nFor example, the Queen, who has paid income tax for two decades and is reportedly quite frugal when it comes to her personal habits, earns investment income and revenue from the Duchy of Lancaster, an estate of almost 19,000 hectares that includes urban developments and farmland.\nPrince Charles receives income from Britain's other duchy, the Duchy of Cornwall, and it's been reported he is covering some of the expenses for renovations to the apartment William and Kate have moved into at Kensington Palace.\nThose renovations have totalled more than $7.3 million Cdn. Some reports suggest the refurbishment of a 350-square-foot kitchen cost more than $310,000. A second, smaller private family kitchen was also added, and reports say that work was financed privately.\nHarris says it's difficult to say how much the structure of the monarchy costs the taxpayer.\n\"There have been a number of figures provided, and sometimes these figures are criticized for not taking into account the full extent of security, for instance,\" she says.\n\"Certainly there are republicans who've argued that \u2026 as the Crown lands are administered by the state, if there wasn't a monarchy that perhaps this percentage would go towards other public projects and not toward the monarchy,\" says Harris.\n\"But there are expenses attached to any head of.",

This looks like a great game to keep an eye on.\nSecret Ponchos by Switchblade Monkeys was another Indie game I had played before at Prime and I was eager to see it again. It is coming out to PS4 and it is a team-based, arena western game. They have added a new character that is focused on close combat. I prefer Phantom Poncho, who uses a shotgun. The game is fast paced and looks be in early access this summer.\nI also checked out Grimm Bros Dragon Fin Soup. They recently had a successful kickstarter and as a result, had a playable demo of their game. I saw some of Hotline Miami and that game looks like its going to better than the original. If gamers haven\u2019t played the original, they need to pick it up.\nThere were a few other games that really caught my eye at the Indie Booth. One of these was Strike Vector. This is a space flight simulation that features dogfights. I like that it is fast paced and gamers can choose their dual weapon and item loadouts. I highly recommend checking out the site.\nBelow, from Capy, was another game I played for a while. The music fit the game perfectly, as it seems to be the ideal dungeon crawler, which plays on the idea of being alone in a big world.\nI played many other great indie games at PAX East: Catlateral Damage, Tiny Dice, Tower of Guns, BroForce, Drunken Robot Pornography, and the list goes on and on. If I had to choose an Indie game of the show, it might be Hotline Miami 2 or Galax-Z.\nMore information on all the Indie Games at PAX can be found here.",

The purchase or the sale of a single investment option in a future time based on current price point is permitted with this trading contract. Brokers with a great know-how of what CFDs are all about and how it\u2019s done are people who can make big earnings here.\nCisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) will report its fiscal second-quarter after the close of trading on Wednesday. Since so many investors have been burned here, this could be a make-or-break quarter for the networking giant. It seems as though the bar has been set low for this report, but the company remains plagued by order weakness in China and many emerging markets. As far as why the bar is set low, the expectations are that this quarter and next quarter sales and \u2026\nGreat success can be obtained in a really short time frame if you have wisely invested your money in CFD Singapore.

This way there are a number of opportunities to make a profit on several trades rather that long term trades held past the period of a day trading period. Taking advantage of an option such as discount volume trading, when it is offered by your agent can be beneficial to making you some money from profit earnings.\nMargin day trading is made possible by brokers who\u2019ll be prepared to risk a part of the funds that you require to make a trade decision. This works just like a loan does from a bank and will often require that the borrower/trader repay it as soon as possible during the day trading cycle. This can be extended into the next day but interest fees will most probably be incurred and this will vary from broker to broker and only available on promising leads. This can be very dangerous for borrowers as if they lose money, they end up owing more to the factor in the long run.\nStock trading in this particular area involves a search for markets, indices and securities that can generate massive returns. Going short is a strategy that is used by traders interested in the front act of selling contracts and it is very popular. This basically involves the acquisition of contracts when the prices have fallen. Real time advantages are offered here because it can be used for short term gains.

My broker has informed me that no form 1099 is issued in respect of earnings from options trading. That being so, how does the IRS know what earnings an options trader had in a given year?\nThe IRS will not know from the brokerage firms reporting what profit you have earned from trading options. However is subsuquent years they might uncover your brokerage account statements and discover the under reporting there. A reminder you can deduct trading and financial advisory expense in certian cases. ( this expenses might offset your trading profits). Check with your tax advisor\nThey are not reported.\nOptions trading is a very complex issue to which there could be an exception but generally I have found that all the options trades are reported. The taxpayer is responsible to calculate the earnings as they are with stock sales. If the taxpayer fails to correctly calculate and keep records to prove that gain or loss to the IRS should they be subject to an audit the taxpayer has a major problem.

Certified Mold hygienist and Certified Advanced Mold Inspector.\nCONSUMER ALERT!\nBeware of Mold Inspection Companies that also do Mold Remediation Repairs. Their testing is designed to offer a Free Inspection, but drive up the cost through Mold Remediation. Ask questions, remember nothing is FREE! Use an unbiased Certified Mold Inspector.\nHi, I'm William O'Gorman, Owner of Mold Inspections and Lab Tests in San Diego, Calif. When someone calls me they think that they may have a unique mold problem and they don't know where to start. The first thing is we have to determine if you do indeed have a mold problem or water damage problem and then we can start from there.\n- Tenants\u2019 Rights - There is help. A new law went into effect in 2016 that helps protect a tenant from a landlord who is unresponsive or does shoddy work on a potential mold or water intrusion problem. The Code Enforcement Department in your city is mandated that when they receive a complaint from a tenant, they will send a Code Enforcement Officer to their home to evaluate and document their complaints. If the Code Enforcement Officer believes their complaints have merit, the next step is that a letter of a Code Compliance will be sent to their landlord, giving the landlord 30 days to address all of the complaints or they will face a fine of $1,000 to $,2500 a day for each day past 30 days. There are no fees for this service.\n- Landlord Rights - You have the right, within 30 days from the date of the letter, to address the complaints and have them certified. There is help. I know what Code Enforcement needs to close their file. I have helped landlords through this process. Please call and have your Code Enforcement letter in hand.\n- Home sellers - Doing a pre-sale home mold inspection would be a wise idea. When it comes to detected mold and water problems, it generally happens near the end of the escrow and there may not be enough time to correct the problem. The deal may fall apart and then you still have to fix the problem for the next buyer, and who knows when they may come along? It's good insurance to have a pre-sale mold inspection.\n- Home Buyers - You only have one shot to find out potential problems while you are in escrow. When I walk into a home for the inspection, I have the attitude that someone is hiding something from my customer. I have thousands of mold inspections under my belt, and I have made my customers thousands of dollars. If you are buying a bank-owned house, you have to remember that the bank has nothing to disclose and also the previous owner had no money to fix any mold or water problems. I have a nice system for this and with the proper documentation in your hands, we can get all of these problems fixed or the costs deducted from the sale. Don't be fooled when the bank says, \"It's an as-is sale.\" It's an as-is sale when they have the money in their hands. If your deal falls through for any reason, then the bank has documentation that they have to disclose to the next buyer that may be a year down the road. My system works. That's why I am used by hundreds of realtors in San Diego County.\n- Realtors - What I know about this mold business is that I would not buy a shack in this state without the proper inspections. The buyer is relying on you to guide them through the biggest purchase of their life. When a buyer moves into their new home and they start finding major problems that could have been detected by proper inspections, the first person they want to sue is the realtor. You want to do the right thing for your customer and you. Our lab report documentation will help protect you at the close of escrow.\n- Homeowners - If you or a family member has health concerns, mold spores may be the problem. There are many conditions associated with mold. We have to determine what types of mold we are dealing with, and you may have to go to a doctor who specializes in mold. A home inspection and air quality test may help you identify the problem or eliminate it. I have taken over 25,000 lab samples and completed over 7,500 home inspections, so you know you are in good hands.\n- Prices - I purchase, in advance, 1,000 prepaid lab tests and by doing this, I receive a big discount and I pass these savings on to my customers. In some cases, we may need more than two tests. I would rather you over-test than under-test. I do not make extra money on the extra test. Home inspection and two free lab tests are $239. Any additional tests if we need them are $25 extra per test.\nMold remediation San Diego may not be needed. Let us do all the pre-testing and free inspection to determine if you really have a problem.\nToxic mold remediation San Diego?

    "context": "I received a copy of this book via Penguin\u2019s First To Read program, so many thanks to them for making it available. While it was provided to me at not cost to myself, I am not obligated to give a positive review.\nSomehow, I have managed to not read anything by Krentz before, whether it be as Krentz or under a nom de plume such as Amanda Quick or Jayne Castle. I know she\u2019s perceived as writing romantic suspense, but that\u2019s not why I haven\u2019t read anything by her before. Simply put, I just haven\u2019t.\nThat said, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect with this offering. But I always give things a fair read, otherwise, how would you discover new authors?\nThis story opens with our protagonist, Lucy Sheridan, being saved from a potentially bad situation at a party by Mason Fletcher, a young man who\u2019s a few years older and who always seems to be the one to stand up for others and rescuing them. Lucy is, like many teens, not so understanding or grateful to her rescuer. Mason, after returning Lucy home, confronts Tristan, the spoiled rich brat who had hoped to take advantage of Lucy, instructing him to leave Lucy alone. Shortly after, Tristan mysteriously disappears, and his body is never found.\nFast forward to thirteen years later, when Lucy\u2019s aunt has passed away, leaving Lucy with the inheritance. Lucy returns to Summer River to find that much has changed. What used to be a sleepy little town has now been swallowed up by the wine industry. Vineyards surround the town, and the people too have changed. And not all of them are happy to see Lucy again.\nNaturally, when Lucy returns to Summer River, she reconnects with Mason again. He\u2019s pretty much the same, wanting to do things for her, and not surprisingly, Lucy\u2019s the same way, not wanting to be helped. Some things never change. At least at first. As the story develops, so does their romance. But of course, we pretty well knew that from the opening scene. It just seemed natural they\u2019d find their way back around to each other, right? \ud83d\ude42\nAs Lucy begins preparing her aunt\u2019s house for sale, the renovations uncover something interesting that pulls folks related to her aunt and Tristan into their lives. And as I noted earlier, they aren\u2019t too happy to see she and Mason poking around.\nSo the story develops and moves along, Lucy getting into hot water, Mason having to save her, or Lucy saving herself. Reluctantly, she begins to see his worth, and hey, his good looks don\u2019t hurt his cause any.\nSo what really happened to Tristan? Was the car accident that killed Lucy\u2019s aunt and friend really an accident? Who\u2019s got the secrets to hide and why?\nI really liked the way that Krentz developed this story. I\u2019m not opposed to a little romance in my suspense, although perhaps a bit less in this case. But it\u2019s not overbearing at all. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a romance novel with suspense as a subplot. Certainly, Krentz has published enough books, and successfully so I might add, in different genres that she knows how to craft a good story.\nAs noted earlier, I haven\u2019t read any of Krentz\u2019s other novels to know if they are formulaic, but I will certainly let this story stand on its own for the time being. It was, at its core, a well-crafted romantic suspense novel with enough twists and turns to keep the reader wanting to turn the page. What more could you ask for in a book?\nRating: 4 stars (out of 5)\nPingback: Review: River Road by Jayne Anne Krentz | Smexy Books",

It was said that by pricing the car exactly right Porsche executives had cornerstoned the market. The Boxter S was cunningly underpriced, so that when it was actually purchased, it would rise in value. Thus the demand for these cars was massive, and due to the waiting list, people tried to buy second hand, from Porsches own recently established second-hand dealers.\nTo outline basically the influences on demand for the Boxter:\n1) Features of the car, i.e. Safety, Power, Speed etc\n2) Reputation of the Porsche group in both the manufacture of race-cars and road-cars\n3) Perceived future value of the Boxter S\n4) Available customer choice\n5) Lack of competition in this field\n6) Rarity of the good\nAnd to outline the influences on supply:\n1) Limited available production due to there only being one Porsche production plant\n2) Personal customisation of the vehicles\n3) Purposeful creation of rarity\nIn 1997/98, Porsche was able to expand its business because of the strong demand for the 911 and Boxster models. The Group\u2019s sales rose by 13 percent to 36,686 vehicles, its turnover by 20 percent to 4.9 billion DM. This was thanks to a high volume of orders in hand and a cautious medium-term hedging policy against possible exchange-rate fluctuations in the most important currencies, earnings and turnover prospects for the current year are also encouraging. Due to continuing strong demand for both model lines, Porsche were almost certain to increase the previous year\u2019s high production and sales levels still further in 1998/99. Since Porsche is engaged in optimising processes throughout the Group, further strengthening of the company\u2019s internal earning power is anticipated. Looking into the future, Porsche has also hedged against possible fluctuations and weaknesses of the most important currencies in the medium to long term.\nIn Frankfurt, Porsche, the sportscar maker, announced on Tuesday that group sales for the fiscal year ended July 31 were up 24 per cent to DM6.1bn ($3.2bn), against DM4.9bn one year earlier.\nUnit sales were 20 per cent higher at 43,980 from 36,686 last year. The company described pre-tax profit in 1999 as \u201creasonable\u201d but declined to provide exact figures.\nDespite expenses associated with the development of a new four-wheel drive vehicle, Porsche said it aimed to match last year\u2019s earnings in the current business.",
    "question": "What were the factors influencing the demand for the Porsche Boxter?",
    "answer": "The factors influencing the demand for the Porsche Boxter were the features of the car such as safety, power, speed, the reputation of the Porsche group in both the manufacture of race-cars and road-cars, perceived future value of the Boxter S, available customer choice, lack of competition in this field, and rarity of the good.",

    "context": "2017 saw the cinematic release of \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a movie that was centered around a very popular anime one that spawned multiple animated movies itself and an animated series beforehand.\nGrowing up, I watched one of the anime adaptations, \u201cGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.\u201d\nAs a teenager, I enjoyed the series, it was never my favorite show, but I took enjoyed watching it well enough.\nWhen I heard of the 2017 cinematic movie, I was more intrigued than excited. After watching the trailer and reading the synopsis, I dismissed it entirely.\nI wasn\u2019t interested in the transformation of a strong female lead into the pale Hollywood version the movie had.\nIn the anime, I enjoyed the female lead, Major. She was often a cold character and the fact she was literally downloaded into a completely artificial body made many around question if she was literally a ghost in the shell. Hence the name. Major herself was never a vulnerable character, and if she did question her own humanity, it was very much left to the viewer to guess if she ever had an issue with it.\nThe movie did not go this route. The marketing for the cinematic release showed a character that was on a journey to discover how she was created (in the show I watched, she always knew how she was created and who she was), and the movie looked like your traditional \u201cwho am I\u201d storyline that has been overdone to death.\nBecause of this, I never bothered to watch the cinematic release, and I highly doubt I ever will.\nStill, I never pondered whether the movie would be a success. I simply shrugged and moved on with my day. Then I heard about Netflix\u2019s adaptation of the anime, \u201cDeath Note,\u201d and it piqued my interest \u2014 this adaptation I did watch. The Netflix series wasn\u2019t great by any means, but if I ignored any connection to the source material I found, I could enjoy it. Just like \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d I moved on after watching it and never thought twice about it again.\nBut maybe I should have.\nThe world of anime and the fandom that watches it has always been viewed in a very narrow way in my experience. Much like comic lovers, those who watch it are often assumed to be somewhat social outcasts. My favorite example, or rather the example that I loathe the most, would be the portrayal of the character, Sheldon, from the popular show, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d\nSheldon is, for all intents and purposes, supposed to be \u201cweird,\u201d and his character is imprinted on many people's minds of what to expect from someone who watches anime or reads comics.\nSheldon is awkward, often obnoxious and doesn\u2019t seem to understand how to actually exist in society. His portrayal had always been how I felt many viewed those who liked anime, comics or any other fandoms that were less than mainstream.\nAnd I believe it was at least for some time before that changed.\nOften as a teenager and an adult, the most common response I received from someone, including one of my closest friends, to finding I enjoyed anime was shock and a whole lot of confusion mixed with strange looks.\nBut I\u2019m starting to think this response may not be the common one anymore.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in anime\u2019s popularity and I find myself continuing to enjoy a culture that may no longer be considered a niche market. Animes such as \u201cDeath Note\u201d and \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d have grown a large fan base, creating a stronger acceptance of anime.\nSerious cinematic adaptations such as \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d and it\u2019s Netflix equivalent, \u201cDeath Note,\u201d may not be true to their source materials, but they open up a larger audience to that source material.\nBack when the cinematic adaptation of the anime, \u201cDragon Ball,\u201d titled \u201cDragonball Evolution\u201d came to the big screen in 2009, I doubt any anime lover would have thought that future anime adaptations would star actors, such as Scarlett Johansson and Willem Dafoe.\nI\u2019m not sure where this trend began. I highly suspect it began with the popularity of comic book movies, but how that translated into the acceptance of anime I am unsure.\nAll I know is the idea of my favorite animes such as \u201cFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood\u201d and \u201cBaccano\u201d making it to the cinematic big screen or into a mini series doesn\u2019t seem so far away. And when they do come to the big screen, I don\u2019t think other anime fans will be the only one\u2019s excited to see them either..",

    "context": "Buso Renkin (2006-2007)\nDirector: Takao Koto\nIMDb Overview:\nAlchemy showdown!\nAnime News Network Overview:.\nA Buso Renkin Review\nBuso Renkin Episode Count: 26 episodes\nWhile a very high tech original anime, Buso Renkin is really a bizarre one (in my experience). While things are always ending up in twists and new revelations. Buso Renkin\u2019s story begins with a good overall beginning. Kazuki Moto wondering an abandoned building where a homonculus attacks and he dies. Soon after he wakes up from this with what he supposes is the truth, the chilling reality is by far more complex than that. He died but was saved at the last moment by a strange device (named a Kakugane medallion) that kept his heart beating thanks to Tokiko Tsumura. She is a type of alchemist who had been on a mission until she stumbled on ,Kazuki, being almost killed, so interfered in hopes of saving him. Later, Kazuki wakes up like any other day trying to make sense if his death happened (or him almost dying. He did die but planted the Kakugane medallion in his heart giving him life again). Having brief flashbacks to what really happened he decides to go back to the moment he supposedly died. You\u2019d think he\u2019d learn to stay away but he doesn\u2019t and the same homonculus is still there. But really can\u2019t forget the girl who saved him and feels an intense feeling of gratitude. This time when around when he returns he isn\u2019t so defenseless and finds that he is rather strong against this humonculus. Tokiko when seeing him can\u2019t believe how well can he handle and wield the kakugane or that it\u2019s activating at all to his wield to fight. To her its a seemingly really unconventional and doesn\u2019t know whether if its from the itself or from own latent power. Whatever the reason, is going to find soon enough that something is really wrong with him because of his new heart implant. In this way Kazuki and Tokiko are thrust into a world of the homomculus and Buso renkin (arms alchemy) together.\nBuso Renkin doesn\u2019t stay boring for long if it ever was. Changes a lot throughout the anime with varying entertaining cast of both friends and enemies. Papillon who dresses in a black and purple butterfly unitard. He is one of the first major villains that comes to mind.While sensitive sometimes he also has a quick changing mood. Although he can be a really hilarious guy at times too and a wise thinker. Though he\u2019s a villain at first it becomes interesting to see he later is one of Kazuki and Tokiko\u2019s closest allies. While another early ally is Captain Bravo.The guy has really amazing (as in a\u2013 beautiful to look at) character design along with other characters and the world in general in Buso Renkin. Kazuki is often mentioned to adore Tokiko, so much he\u2019s willing to fight to protect her at very extreme lenghts seen in the anime. When he does Buso Renkin shows its action empowered with moments of action suspense that\u2019s exquisite to watch. For in its own right the fights are fierce at times. In Buso Renkin there that are individuals that are capable to harness abilities with the use of kagukanes that all, are unique to their users. They are then ranked by how strong their abilities are. The world of Buso Renkin is sort of mecha (machine created) but it doesn\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s entirely unique with a terrific plot as well as character development. As far as the animation itself it really has a great array of well-designed characters. The animation is clean in nice lighting and bright. Found highly attractive and new from most anime serieses.\nBuso Renkin is much more recommended to fans of Inuyasha (a comparison that\u2019s a bit close) and anime watchers that love a plot that\u2019s really action filled but with an injection of romance. Buso Renkin find brings really tough animation and the thrill of high action together with some romance which is not all badly combined.\nGenre: Action/Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Romance, Alchemy\nContains: Dark side, Developing Powers\nAnime Soundtrack Side-note: The opening for the anime of Buso Renkin was pretty nice. Felt went well with the overall anime. The Opening theme song was \u201cMakka Na Chikai\u201d by Yoshiki Fukuyama.The Closing theme songs found alright. The closing theme for the first half of the series was \u201cHoshiakari\u201d by Jyukai. For the second half of the series it was \u201cItoshiki Sekai\u201d by Aya Kagami.",

    "context": "Road to Nowhere\n10 July 2009 // 22:41\nBy David Cameron - 3 comments\nToday, the Nurburgring is oh so very cold. It's not as though I wasn't warned \u2013 I came out of a meeting yesterday to a voicemail message from Alexa which noted that \u201cit is freaking cold here\u201d at least five times in about 30 seconds \u2013 but the cold still caught me by surprise when we walked past the building site outside and into the paddock.\nThis morning it felt as though the circuit had never hosted a summer.\n\u201cMan it's cold here,\u201d Mark Glendenning noted at the coffee machine, showing the sort of insight that he is rightly famous for. \u201cIsn't it supposed to be July now?\u201d Mark is a fellow Australian who works for Autosport magazine: we've been mates since we worked together in another life, more years ago than we care to remember. \u201cYeah, but what I want to know is how I can get someone to drive me around the Nordschleife. You've done that, haven't you?\u201d \u201cYeah, it's amazing, especially when it gets up through Karusel: go through there fast enough, and you may need some more underwear.\u201d \u201cI think we need to steal a driver to do a lap.\u201d A quick scan of the room gave me the perfect victim: \u201cHey Filippi, we need you to drive us around the old circuit.\u201d \u201cIs it still open? I thought they closed it now.\u201d \u201cI think one of the German car companies rents the place for the weekend,\u201d Mark suggested. \u201cDamn, you don't have any links with them, do you?\u201d \u201cNo, but I want to do it! Maybe I will just keep going at the end of race two!\u201d \u201cI don't think you want to do that: you'd do huge damage to the underside of your car. When Heidfeld did it in the F1 car last time they had to run it as high as physically possible.\u201d \u201cAh, in that case maybe I'll just take Villa's car instead!\u201d\nThe Nurburgring is a circuit the Italian loves, so you can see why he might want to stay on it for a bit longer, although given his luck here you can find an equal reason for wanting to get back to the pits and out of the way: after qualifying well he was nerfed out of the race at turn one last time by S\u00e9bastien Buemi, who came over to apologise only to get the talk to the hand treatment and the cutting, but not inaccurate, comment \u201cyou should go back to Formula 3\u201d...\nHe's not the only one with bad luck here: the FMSI team were struggling after both cars were out in free practice, with Andi Zuber spinning at turn one and Luiz Razia having a big impact with the wall out of turn ten. Zuber tried to bluff his way through when I asked him what happened afterwards, but eventually he had to admit the truth.\n\u201cI've been doing one of those drifting courses in Germany this week, you know? I love doing that: it was so much fun. So anyway, I enjoyed it so much, and it's been in my head ever since, and when I was out there today I though 'I wonder if it's possible to drift a GP2 car?' So I thought I'll try it at turn one, the perfect place for it.\n\u201cIt turns out, it's not...\u201d\nRazia was less fortunate than his teammate: although he got through the accident unharmed the same couldn't be said for his car, as the whole rear had to be replaced. His mechanics were immediately on the job, and they did an amazing job: working under incredibly tight time constraints and foregoing lunch they pushed hard to get the car rebuilt in time for qualifying, their arms and hands still a blur over the car as the rest of the field made their way out to the pitlane.\nEventually they finished, but as the session had already started they were unable to use the usual method to get on track, a small entrance gate just after the pit exit next to the medical facilities: needless to say race control were unable to allow them to pop out there on safety grounds. But cognisant of the hard work the boys had put in, an alternate route around the back of the F1 paddock was found, and the series organisers asked if it would be okay to allow them to make use of it, as it eventually worms around to the top end of the pitlane.\nHappily they were given the okay, and a quick check to make sure the route was clear gave Luiz the chance to blast down the alley and make use of his mechanics handiwork. Andi made up for his previous blushes by pulling in sixth on the grid tomorrow, while Luiz will just be happy to line up on the grid for his first race here.\nMeanwhile, Luca managed to blot his copybook on a very hot lap and spun to a halt at the chicane, throwing away a good grid position in the process. If I were the marshals here, I'd make sure there is something a little more than a few cones to block the way onto the old circuit tomorrow: given his grid position, the Italian may have his mind on other things than the race.\nFirst comment! Woo!... Only comment? Sad!\nNice new design by the way\nHaha, Andi is so funny\nLiking the new look... didn't realise the first 'send' button is actually a 'preview' button though\nLove the new layout!\nlol at the drifting guy!\nAlso: doing a lap on the old circuit is amaaaazing, even in a roadcar.",

For this all-new album, he sings selections both familiar and less well-known as well as duets with soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. Highlghts include selections from I Pagliacci, Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, Roberto Devereux and many more.\nA cynic might look at Roberto Alagna\u2019s new disc, \u2018My Life is an Opera\u2019, and think, \u2018At least he admits it\u2019. From his stormy La Scala stage departure to his relationship with Angela Gheorghiu, Alagna\u2019s personal life is\u2026well, operatic. Somewhat embarrassingly, the disc\u2019s booklet has each of the arias listed (out of order from their disc sequencing) to illustrate some signpost in his life, though instead of dealing with the aforementioned incidents in this loose autobiography, the text speaks of the \u2018meteoric\u2019 rise of this \u2018golden-voiced handsome young genius\u2019. (Oh dear.)\nBut anyone who thought the medium-weight Alagna voice was on the way out with his Radam\u00e8s and Otello might be dumbfounded at his excellent state of vocal health on the disc, and the sure dramatic instincts behind it. Most of the repertoire seems new to Alagna\u2019s discography, though there are very few signs of having just learnt arias from Gluck\u2019s Orfeo, The Queen of Sheba (both the Gounod and Goldmark versions) and Reyer\u2019s Sigurd.\nAside from forays into Puccini\u2019s Manon Lescaut and Leoncavallo\u2019s Pagliacci, the programme seems to signify a re-commitment to his fundamentally mid-weight lyric vocal personality, not playing safe in the way he builds phrases and longer-term musical climaxes but rarely pushing his limits (the closest he comes is in an excerpt from his brother David Alagna\u2019s opera Le dernier jour d\u2019un condamn\u00e9 ). Lensky\u2019s aria from Eugene Onegin is in French translation, not Russian. Bel canto choices such as the dramatically charged duet from Roberto Devereux (with Aleksandra Kurzak) don\u2019t require serious coloratura.\nThe biggest vocal surprise is \u2018Magische T\u00f6ne\u2019 from the Goldmark Sheba, in which Alagna goes into the falsetto stratosphere with a musico-dramatic effect that stands well alongside performances by the great tenors of the past, including Nicolai Gedda and Leo Slezak. Alagna doesn\u2019t have a particularly strong-minded collaborator in the London Orchestra (an ensemble I\u2019ve never heard of) and its Director Yvan Cassar.

It was the first visit since Turkey shot down a Russian warplane in November.\nRussia has supported the Syrian government in the past year by sending dozens of jets and attack helicopters to Syria to carry out airstrikes against rebel forces.\nTurkey has long supported Syrian rebels fighting President Assad's regime forces during the five-year civil war.\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly called for Turkey to take more steps to seal its border with Syria to ISIS fighters.\nTurkey's military operation into northern Syria Wednesday was seen as a welcomed step by senior defense officials in Washington.\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

    "context": "Here's a Throwback Thursday impression of a daytime ride on Amtrak's Crescent last fall. A previous Throwback Thursday got us from Washington, D.C. to Atlanta, and a recent book review featured historic Birmingham. Next stop: New Orleans. No reason to book a sleeper on the day portion of the journey, and riding coach is a useful way to learn the purpose to which people put the train.\nIn much of the Amtrak network, there is one train a day, and if it goes any distance, many of the cities are served only by night. Thus Minnesota and the eastern Dakotas, and I have more racked for that line. The Crescent is a night train between the capital and Atlanta, and a day train from Atlanta to the Gulf. When it's running late, that has to be nerve-racking for people relying on it to make a commitment. For a vacationing ferroequinologist, having it on time or close to time is a good thing.\nAmtrak 19 Crescent, Birmingham to New Orleans, 23 October 2014: Genesis diesels 148 - 40, deadheading Amfleet II lounge 28022, Amfleet coaches 25055 - 25019 - 25111 - 25060, lounge 28019, diner 8507, Viewliner sleepers 62023 - 62019, baggage 1738. Train is close to time.\nThe passenger facilities at Birmingham make use of the former baggage area in what's left of the Louisville and Nashville station. There once was a proper Union Station but like so many in the Sun Belt, they went for redevelopment before Amtrak. Primitive facilities or not, the waiting room is full of passengers, and a full cart-load of luggage went on the baggage car.\nScheduled departure time is 12.08; get away 12.14. Meet 20 also close to time east of Tuscaloosa. Tuscaloosa 1.30 - 1.33.\nThe station is reminiscent of the old and new Sturtevant, Wisconsin stations that several times a day have two trains in or near the platforms. But the University of Alabama has more passenger train service than the University of Wisconsin or the University of Tennessee or Northern Illinois University. It's midafternoon Thursday. Perhaps there's more traffic on and off at weekends.\nTrain is running well although not ballast-scorching in the Milwaukee Road way. Meridian 3.13 - 3.19.\nThe Meridian Union Station has enough platforms and track to be worthy of the Michigan corridor or the New England end of the Northeast Corridor, although (as is often the case) the tracks closest to the building are out of service. Train crews change here. Although the Meridian and Bigbee Railroad make their presence known to Amtrak passengers who look out the window, the local short lines are not in the excursion business.\nThe real Gulf, Mobile and Ohio railroad used to serve Meridian, and a real Gulf, Mobile and Ohio train featured in the opening scenes of In the Heat of the Night, but the Hollywood Meridian didn't look like this. Away from Atlanta, and as we will later see, Houston and Dallas, the smaller Sun Belt cities have some of the same forlorn properties of the smaller cities of the Rust Belt.\nLaurel 4.24 - 4.26, Hattiesburg 4.57 - 5.01, and the ride is turning into a University of Mississippi reunion of sorts, with more than a few passengers enroute Baton Rouge for a tilt with Louisiana State. I wish them well -- that Wisconsin collapse in the second half earlier in the fall still rankles. Picayune 6.02 - 6.05, Slidell 6.24 - 6.26. Now the railroad goes to sea.\nThe railroad's causeway across Lake Pontchartrain has a highway bridge to its south. I have a seat on the north side of the train, and the sun is setting. Once into the New Orleans terminal area, there's a good deal of junctions traversed, and pulling ahead and setting back. Arrive New Orleans 7.25, seven minutes to the good.\nThat part of the South never had a corridor service in the way Minnesotans or Michiganians, let alone residents of the Official Region understand it, and thus the Amtrak service simply kept what was there in 1971. Cut the running time Birmingham to New Orleans to five hours thirty and add a second train, it just might work. And I could win the Irish Sweep.\nThere's more evaluation of the Amtrak network to come.\n30.7.15\nTHE OVERPURPOSED TRAIN.",

    "context": "Slow cooker honey orange chicken gives you the taste and flavor of Chinese takeout without all the breading and oil!\nI\u2019m pretty sure the first time I had Chinese takeout I was in college\u2014 my family never ordered it growing up! Our weekly food tradition was Friday night pizza night and my Mom cooked most other nights. But Ted\u2019s family had [and still has] an affinity for Chinese takeout. And since I\u2019m no longer in college and married to man that loves good Chinese food, its can be found on our menu every now and then. Want to know what I think about this new tradition? Why the heck didn\u2019t my parents jump on the Chinese takeout bandwagon when I was a little girl!!!\nSeriously though, what\u2019s not to love about it? Plenty of sauce, lots of oil, and breaded and fried chicken can be found on most Chinese food menus. While I love someone doing all the cooking for me, my waistline thinks otherwise. Instead of nixing Chinese food all together, Ted and I made some compromises. And that compromise involved me making one of his favorites at home: orange chicken. But as the title of this recipe tells you, I\u2019ve changed up the recipe and made a slow cooker honey orange chicken. Less oil. Less fat. And a lot of flavor! And it\u2019s made in the slow cooker\u2026 cha-ching!\nWhile it seems strange to cook meat in the slow cooker with variable temps and times, I assure you cubed chicken cooks quickly\u2014 not matter what the slow cooker temp. This adjustment in heat from high to low also helped my sauce thicken and prevent the chicken from overcooking. And if you opt for a higher temperature the entire cooking time OR need more than 4 hours for cooking, keep the chicken breasts whole! And one more thing: for those of you that live in the metro Detroit area, I\u2019d love to hear your favorite Chinese takeout restaurant. We have yet to find one we like other than a chain!\nSkip the takeout and make your own honey orange chicken in the slow cooker! Click To Tweet\n- 2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 2-inch cubes\n- \u00bd cup orange marmalade\n- \u00bc cup all-purpose flour\n- \u00bc cup honey BBQ sauce\n- \u00bc cup soy sauce\n- \u00bd teaspoon sesame oil\n- 3 cloves of garlic, crushed\n- Pinch of red pepper flakes\n- For Serving:\n- Brown rice, green onions and sesame seeds\n- Optional: Stir orange zest in at the end for extra flavor!\n- Spray the insert of your slow cooker with non-stick cooking spray. Add all of the ingredients and stir well to combine.\n- Cover and cook on high for four hours, stirring halfway through. Then reduce slow cooker to warm and let rest for an additional hour, to let sauce thicken.\n- Serve immediately with brown rice, and top with green onions and sesame seeds.\nI really love your blog! The recipes I\u2019ve tried so far are huge hits with my toddler, and I have really appreciated when you share your own vulnerabilities \u2013 it\u2019s very relatable (especially your picture of the difference between the 1st and 2nd pregnancy at 3 months! I\u2019m experiencing that now. Wow.) Plus, I went to high school with Ted, so it\u2019s fun to catch up. Thank you!\nThank you so much Kathryn!! What a small world. Ted saw your comment too and laughed! I hope I continue to share recipes you love\u2026 Your toddler too ? stay in touch!\nYum! This sounds fantastic, and I love that it doesn\u2019t have all that extra stuff in it. Perfect for my whole family. Pinning!\nI have never been so excited for a recipe! I love Orange Chicken but hate the options at local restaurants. This gives me the ability to make it at home and enjoy whenever we\u2019d like, without the hassle of ordering out.\nOh this looks great! I\u2019m always looking for slow cooker recipes. Pinning!\nThis sounds and looks amazing! I love a new crockpot meal. I can\u2019t wait to try this out!!\nMy husband will love me more than ever if I make this for him! The only thing is I don\u2019t have a slow cooker (I know, head bowed in shame!). I just got a free pressure cooker \u2013 not sure the difference \u2013 can I make it in that? Or if I make it in regular pan how would you adjust?\nThanks what an awesome dish\nadded the juice of half a stick of celery ,\n1 more garlic clove\nFresh ginger juice about 15 ml\nquarter large onion finely chopped\nfound this dish at its peak 2hours of cooking..4 hours chicken dries out dries out\nBalance of the sauce reduce and use as an awesome rib basting\nSmelt really nice cooking. Had to slightly thicken the sauce. Only problem was couldn\u2019t taste the orange marmalade or the bbq honey sauce. Got one portion left so will have that for lunch.\nHas anyone tried to make this with gluten free flour?\nNot sure what happened? I stirred all the ingredients together then added chicken. The sauce was so thick I added about 1/4 cup of water to thin it. I was worried adding more would affect the flavour. It didn\u2019t help at all. It was edible but not attractive. I wouldn\u2019t make it again. Was the flour maybe to coat the chicken prior to placing in crock pot and not to just throw in with the sauce??\nHi Tammy\u2013 thanks so much for your message! I added my flour to the sauce vs. coating the chicken. Did it taste ok? Did the sauce stick to the pan? Slow cookers are so finicky\u2026 Hence why mine was cooked on low. Sorry it didn\u2019t turn out like mine!!\nMe again \ud83d\ude42 So I tried the recipe again and ended up doing something different\u2014 I cooked it on high for a few hours, then put it on warm for AT LEAST one hour. That really helped to speed up the thickening process!\ni bet this tastes lovely. Thanks for sharing this, gonna give this a go later. Simon\nThank you!\nHow can i make a whole chicken in the crockpot for this recipe pls.\nMade this last night! It was absolutely delicious. I placed it in my cook book. I used sweet baby rays honey BBQ and orange marmalade with the peels. I also added some honey for extra sweetness! Thanks much\nI want to make this weekend! Could you use almond flour instead of all purpose flour?\nSorry for the delay. I think you definitely could! Did you try the swap?\nI found that it was ready at the half time stir point.",

My heart was heavy as I thought about painful issues some of my friends were dealing with. I was feeling under the weather, tired, and looking at my schedule, was extremely busy.\nI\u2019ve gotten a lot closer to my Heavenly Father in the last few months and I realize when I\u2019m feeling this way what I need to do. I used to run to another person to fill that need or something tangible like food to momentarily distract me from my blah feelings, even though I knew none of those things would satisfy, not really. It\u2019s unfair for me to place that kind of responsibility on those I love. They aren\u2019t responsible for my happiness any more than I can be responsible to make them happy. And food: Really, when I overindulge, I end up feeling worse.\nSo, I chose to talk to Him instead. I got myself to a quiet place and just poured out my soul to the One who can make a difference. I told Him what was bothering me, exactly how I was feeling, and even though I\u2019m sure most of my feelings were irrational or borne from emotional and physical exhaustion, I didn\u2019t feel criticized or judged. Then, I asked God something I\u2019ve started asking of Him more and more lately. I asked Him to love me. I didn\u2019t need Him to tell me He would take care of me, protect me and my loved ones, or fix the issues we were facing. I wasn\u2019t having a faith crisis. I just was having an Eyeore day. I just wanted to feel loved. So, I did just that. I asked Him to somehow, in His own unique way, show me how much He loved me. And then I waited. I didn\u2019t need an instant answer. I didn\u2019t want a quick fix.\nIt\u2019s been a few hours and I\u2019m still waiting. And that\u2019s okay. Because my Father is so personal and from past experiences, I know that He will find a way to personalize how much I mean to Him at just the right time and in just the right way.\nWhat about you? Do you ever just need to feel loved and accepted for who you are? There is a Heavenly Father waiting to show you, in a very personal way, just how much you mean to Him. And you know what? He loves it when we ask. Especially if we\u2019re having one of those days.\n\u00a9 Cheri Swalwell 2014",

    "context": "2017 Platts Nuclear Energy Conference\nI was asked to speak at the Platts Nuclear Energy Conference in Washington, DC, on February 10, as part of their panel on \u201cNew Approaches to Advanced Reactor Design.\u201d\nI began my talk by emphasizing how the generation of \u201cnuclear waste\u201d has become a political problem, with spent fuel sites dotting the country, but that most of this spent fuel is unconsumed uranium and relatively short-lived fission products. Only a small percentage is long-lived transuranic nuclides that have special disposal challenges. The plan to put this spent nuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain runs up against the reality that Yucca Mountain would already be filled to its statutory capacity. Above-ground interim storage is a credible solution to buy time for a better approach. For seventy years, the overwhelming majority of the nuclear community has believed that fast breeder reactors using plutonium was the strategy that we should take, but with thorium and liquid-fluoride reactor technology, there is another and I believe better approach. We should fission the transuranic nuclides in a liquid-fluoride reactor jacketed with a thorium-bearing salt. This will produce uranium-233 even as transuranic nuclides are permanently destroyed. Uranium-233 can then be used to start up sustainable liquid-fluoride thorium reactors (LFTRs) that do not produce transuranic nuclear waste. Existing uranium-233 inventories at Oak Ridge and Idaho National Laboratory should also be preserved.\nFlibe\u2019s LFTR design occupies a unique corner of the design space of molten-salt reactors, different from the other MSR designs being offered.\nI thought that this slide would be helpful for people to understand how the different MSR concepts compare to one another. It places neutron spectrum along the x-axis and nuclear fuels (in a continuum from thorium to uranium) across the y-axis. The thermal spectrum MSR concepts can be seen on the left-hand side. In the upper left-hand corner there\u2019s Flibe Energy\u2019s LFTR concept as well as the Chinese TMSR, the two approaches that are trying to achieve the admirable goal of true operation on thorium through breeding. Then there are uranium designs that are still thermal spectrum. Terrestrial Energy\u2019s IMSR uses uranium fuel, and ThorCon\u2019s design uses both uranium and thorium, but predominantly relies on uranium. But uranium breeding is impossible in the thermal spectrum so neither design has good fuel utilization.\nOutside of the thermal designs there is Transatomic\u2019s WAMSR design, which is intermediate in its spectrum and uses only uranium. And at the uranium-fueled, fast-spectrum corner of the design space, we find the chloride reactor designs: TerraPower\u2019s MCFR, Elysium\u2019s design, and the Moltex design. These reactors use a fast neutron spectrum to achieve uranium breeding, since uranium can only breed in the fast spectrum.\nAn outlier is the European MSFR design, which uses thorium fuel yet has a \u201cfast-ish\u201d spectrum, since it still uses fluoride salts.

    "answer": "The proposed solution to the problem of nuclear waste generation is to fission the transuranic nuclides in a liquid-fluoride reactor jacketed with a thorium-bearing salt. This process will produce uranium-233 even as transuranic nuclides are permanently destroyed. The uranium-233 can then be used to start up sustainable liquid-fluoride thorium reactors (LFTRs) that do not produce transuranic nuclear waste. Existing uranium-233 inventories at Oak Ridge and Idaho National Laboratory should also be preserved.",

While he knows a lot about both programming and hardware, he's short on both time and money; has worked in IT in the past, but he managed to raise enough funds to move on the Greener Pastures in the form of film and game production. While he is not the main backer of these projects, he has put a sizable purse into each, and did most of the leg work in raising funds and finding investors, as well a lot of the cat herding on and off set (more with the directors and editors than with the actors, surprisingly enough).\nI suspect that the funds do exist, and that he just is trying to help me out of my rut with some work therapy, but whatever.\nThe first problem is spec'ing out a low-profile, small footprint development workstation that is beefy enough for Oculus Rift dev, without going over $5K if possible. I've found several small pizzabox and cube customizer systems that fit his requirements, and started to find out about options for a custom OTS build, but that sort of got sidetracked.\nThe second is getting the schedules for upcoming film festivals off of this website (EDIT: oops, pasted the wrong link, now it should be going to the TheTakes website it's actually on). I assume this will mean scraping the page, but I've been meaning to contact the site owners to see if they expose a webservice - no point in doing unnecessary work - though I expect their reply will be, \"what's a webservice?\" So chances are I will need to either find a tool that automates that, or break out the documentation for Beautiful Soup and do it myself.\nBut the one that is most pressing is the website for their latest production. He originally asked me to build it, spring of last year, but I told him I was in no condition mentally to do it and he eventually borke down and found someone who claimed to be a Wordpress expert (the production company already had a WP based site and he wanted to keep things simple). This claim proved to be a baldfaced lie, and now B needs me (well, someone, he just is hoping he can get my mind off of things by having me do it) to figure out why the Fanart Uploader plug-in looks like shit, among other things. So I will need to dig into how Turdpress plug-ins work and determine if this particular one has some parameters for controlling the layout.\nI will be working on finding this last one today, but if anyone can give me any links or pointers to find the answers I need, I would be ever so grateful.\nIf there isn't a web service that can be found easily by googling, just scrape it.\n@lucas1 said in Three-in-one: looking for advice on Turdpress, Ocular Discharge, and screen (sc)raping:\nIf there isn't a web service that can be found easily by googling, just scrape it.\n+1 scraping is super easy, if the markup is reasonably consistent.",

Alumina-copper composites enable the high thermal and electrical conductivity and the high toughness of copper to be combined with the high stiffness, hardness and wear resistance of alumina [1]. This combination of properties possible makes alumina-copper composites particularly interesting for wear applications. The aim of this project was to produce and characterise copper-alumina interpenetrating composites, in particular, the effect of microstructure on the properties. The range of copper content was 15 to 55 % and the range in copper ligament diameter 1 to 30 \u03bcm. The composite was produced by first making porous alumina preforms with a range of porosities and pore sizes, then infiltrating with copper. The effects of copper ligament diameter and copper content on the mechanical and thermal properties as well as wear behaviour were investigated. Based on the microstructure-property relationships, the most promising composition and microstructure combination was found.\nDarmstadt, TU, Diss., 2011\nDownloads per month over past year",

This value-added feature enables both companies to build an IP surveillance system with high video availability regardless of blackouts or network failures.\nBlackouts and network failures are the Achilles' heel for the IP video surveillance system.When these happens, the cameras will be down or lose the network connection. Lost video almost always equals \"lost evidence\" since no one knows what could have happened on the spot at that time, which undermines the surveillance system's effectiveness. The uninterruptible power supply (UPS) may be in place for the cameras, NVRs, and network equipment, but is usually too expensive to be a viable solution.\nWith the edge recording support, the camera can record the video to its local storage (typically an SD or micro SD card) when its connection to the network fails. Once the connection is recovered, the video during the network downtime will be sent to the NVR to fill in the missing parts. Edge recording assures the availability of video, and is anticipated for the mission-critical video surveillance needs, such as bank monitoring or crime suppression.\nThe Brickcom IP cameras with local storage is \"edge recording-ready\" when connected to the DIGIEVER NVR.

The current source of frustration is the continued devaluation of expertise. It seems like Americans are increasingly becoming actively hostile to people who actually know something. It is most obvious in politics. I was reminded of this because of the attacks on Nate Silver by the right in the closing days of the election.\nThe Download:\nI think the main source of the devaluation can be tied to a two things that are very closely related Republicans and religion. lets start with Republicans. It is easy to say it started with the idiot McCain selected for VP. Remember, the one who could not name a newspaper she reads? I suspect it started much earlier. In the 96 election one of the metrics that was used was \u201cWhich candidate would you most want to have a beer with?\u201d Bush was the obvious choice over Kerry. This is an idiotic metric. The reason is that I don\u2019t want to have a beer with the President because I want a President that is so smart that I would sit there quietly and not say anything so as to not embarrass myself. But for the GOP, this is a solid metric, so idiocy rules.\nThe next part is religion. Clearly religion holds back scientific advancement. All you have to do is look to the arguments that the world is 5000 years old and god created the world in 6 days. That BS has been thoroughly refuted (or refudiated \u2013 for any GOP readers) last century. However, the religious are still insisting that it be taught in schools. When you combine these two forces, you end up with approximately half of the electorate who want to remain ignorant and want to be lead by the ignorant and thus the attacks on expertise continue to gain strength. The problem is that in the changing world, it is knowledge and expertise, not ignorance and superstition, that are going to carry the U.S. forward. The world is a complicated place and we need to trust experts even if we do not understand them and not attack them.\nHat Tips:\nExaminer.com, Deadspin, The New York Times, Idiot America, Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons\nTake Action!",

He graduated summa cum laude from St. Francis College of the University of New England in 1963, and earned his doctorate from Brown University in 1968. His areas of specialization ranged from Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec literature, especially poetry and fiction, to nineteenth- and early twentieth-century French literature, especially Stendhal; lyric poetry; the history of aesthetic and critical theory; and French intellectual history. A true native speaker of French, he read Italian, Spanish, German, Medieval Latin, Portuguese, and Classical Greek.\nHe published four monographs. The most recent, Reading Nelligan (2002), has been recognized as \u201ca landmark\u201d reflecting \u201cimpressive breadth and depth of knowledge in nineteenth-century French poetry\u201d (Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec Studies), an \u201cimportant ouvrage\u201d revealing \u201cun fin jugement analytique et synth\u00c3\u00a9tique\u201d (University of Toronto Quarterly) , \"a model of its kind\" (Montr\u00c3\u00a9al Review of Books). The field of Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec studies was a second scholarly focus that Emile developed after establishing himself as a Stendhal specialist: Stendhal Revisited appeared in 1993, Stendhal and Romantic Esthetics in 1985 and La Critique stendhalienne de Balzac \u00c3 Zola in 1979. At his death, Emile had completed about two thirds of a book on Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec poetry of the 1930s.\nHis scholarly standing brought him invitations to serve as the editor of Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec Studies, as a member of the editorial board of Nouvelles \u00c3\u2030tudes francophones, \u00c3\u2030tudes francophones, La Revue francophone, Nineteenth-Century French Studies, and as The French Review\u2019s editor for creative works. He published numerous articles in such journals as The French Review, Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec Studies, Dalhousie French Studies, the International Journal of Canadian Studies, Studies in Canadian Literature/\u00c3\u2030tudes en litt\u00c3\u00a9rature canadienne, Revue francophone, Nineteenth-Century French Studies, French Forum, Studies in Romanticism, and Stendhal Club.\nHe is remembered as a generous collaborator by the professional societies to which he belonged, particularly the American Council for Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec Studies (ACQS), of which he was Vice-President, President, and Past President, and the Conseil International d\u2019\u00c3\u2030tudes Francophones, on whose Executive Committee he served. For his contributions to the development of the field of Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec studies, he received the prestigious Prix du Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec in 2006, an award made by the ACQS executive board in consultation with the Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec government to honor US based non-Canadian scholars for outstanding scholarship and service in the area of Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec studies. The French government made him Chevalier des palmes acad\u00c3\u00a9miques.\nThe twenty-three doctoral dissertations that he directed are a monument to the impact of his intellectual interests on students in the Department (please see below). His former students remember him as an inspired, exceptional teacher. At the undergraduate level, he taught Introduction to Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec literature, Realism and Impressionism in Literature and the Arts, Heroes and Heroines: From Roland to Beckett, The French Intellectual Tradition, Paris: A Social and Cultural History, and Renaissance Humanism. At the graduate level he taught courses in Romanticism, Realism and Naturalism, Studies in Verlaine, Rimbaud and the Symbolists; Stendhal; Baudelaire; Proust; Short Fiction from Nodier to Maupassant; the Contemporary Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec Novel; and Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec Fiction and Poetry since the 1930s.",

I started quilting when I was living with our grandparents in 1964. After I started my family, I only made baby quilts for a lot of years. Now I am fully involved with the Daughters of Dorinda and am loving doing family projects and projects of my own. I have been married to my husband for 42 years. We have 5 children, 4 girls and boy (women and a man) and within the next 10-12 weeks our 12th grandchild will be born. This baby is a girl and will round out the count at 6 of each. Our oldest daughter lives in Washington State, and her 4 children are 10-18. The boys on the ends and 2 girls in between. The rest all live within 70 miles of us. Our second daughter has 1 little boy and the new baby coming. Our third daughter has 4 children, 3 girls and a boy. Our son does not have any children, but has LOTS of horses. And our youngest daughter has 2 boys, 3 & 4 -years old.\nMy career has been in nursing, and I specialized in the Emergency Department. The last 6 years of my career I was the clinical educator for the department at our local hospital. I retired just over a year ago, and my addiction to quilting has become full blown.

I started with a graduation quilt for the oldest grandson, so that will probably be where I will get the quilts to them.\nI am going to do a country theme, either in fall colors or a winter landscape, and I plan to use fabric from my stash to do as much as I can.

Once off the ground it should have crashed. Several times. That it stayed airborne should make all those who came proud.\nAt an unconference there can be a massive surge of ideas powered by conversation and debate. It\u2019s a chance to think and be creative.\nAll that\u2019s great but is that it?\nWhat\u2019s next?\nIn the few days after the event, a new hyperlocal Pelsall Common People was started by Jayne Howarth, Dave Musson at Solihull Council started to do cool things with Facebook and the organisation I work for Walsall Council started to trial Yammer. That\u2019s a tiny tip of a large iceberg.\nHere\u2019s eight things to do after an unconference.\n1. Sit down in a darkened room. If it\u2019s been any good your head is filled with ace ideas and you\u2019ll need a good lie down.\n2. Blog. It\u2019s one of the best ways to get your head around an idea. Besides. Everyone loves a sharer.\n3. Don\u2019t be despondent. If the unconference has been really good you\u2019ll experience mild depression three days later. It\u2019s the ambition \u2013 reality axis. Don\u2019t worry. See 4.\n4. Do a small thing. Take out a Flickr account. Go and set-up a Posterous blog. You don\u2019t have to add content just yet but you\u2019ve feel a whole lot better.\n5. Catch up. Read the blogs and presentations from sessions you couldn\u2019t get to.\n6. Stage an unconference yourself. No, really. Do. Find a few like minded people and do it yourself. They\u2019re very rewarding.\n7. Think of the phrase Just Flipping Do It. Write it on your pump bag if you like. JFDI It\u2019s a good motto for life.\n8. Think of it as training and not a jolly out of the office. Although if they serve cake it should be a fun experience.\nI\u2019ve long thought an unconference works short term and long term. It\u2019s the ideas you can do straight away and it\u2019s the slow burning suggestions that strike you 12 months down the line.\nDo people have to wait for permission or someone else to create a bargovcamp?\nOf course not. You can run one too. It would be hugely cool if from Hyperlocal Govcamp people were inspired to do it themselves.\nTo continue flogging the Punk analogy, when The Sex Pistols first played Manchester half the audience went out and formed bands. We got Joy Division, New Order, and The Buzzcocks. That we got Simply Red too shouldn\u2019t be held against it.\nFor my money, and stay with me here, Localgovcamp in Birmingham was a local government equivalent of the Sex Pistols gig because a slew of inspirational things, events and projects came out of it.\nYour unconference DIY toolkit\nDave Briggs\u2019 guide to setting up an unconference we found indispensible.\nAndy Mabbett said he\u2019d blog on the things we learned and when he does I\u2019ll insert the link [here].\nThere\u2019ll also be a collection of resources from #hyperwm [here] very soon.\nYou can look at the images taken on the day at the #hyperwm Flickr group here.\nJohn Popham points out here that an unconference is a cheap way of training in an era of austerity.\nAbsolutely spot on Dan. Loving the fact that the photographs and blogs will all be linked in one place. Since attending the Hyperlocalgovcamp in Walsall last week; I have given a lot of thought to setting up a blog or blogs. Trouble is the ideas keep flowing thick and fast. I\u2019m also hoping to meet with our corporate communications and web teams and pass on some of the great articles they may inspire them to see #hyperlocal for what it really is \u2026 not a threat but an ally.\nIt was great to meet so many people with the shared JFDI attitude (thanks Dan). If I missed you this time around, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be there next time as there were too many sessions that I wanted to get to but missed.\n@wolvesparkies (also @angelfruity)\n[\u2026] This post was mentioned on Twitter by Dan Slee, sarahlay and Nigel Howle, PublicSectorBloggers.

For example, today I've seen a piece of code (in AXD301 sources) that looked like: case Expr1 of PATTERN1 -> case Expr_with_side_effects of [[{_,0,_,_,}]] -> do_something1(); _ -> do_something2() end; _ -> do_something2() end The strange pattern above is real, other parts are changed of course. Actually this was the reason I wrote this mail: we coudn't find any elegant solution. My suggested (elegant) solution is: case ?MATCH(PATTERN1,Expr1) andalso ?MATCH([[{_,0,_,_,}]],Expr_with_side_effects) of true -> do_something1(); _ -> do_something2() end Other example: The whole ets:match is about matching against a pattern containing only '_'s. But yes, you got the point: The patterns should be allowed to contain any variables, because having a variable more than once in a pattern is useful (this is why patterns for ets:match can contain '$1','$2'... stuff, but that's ugly). > * One could rewrite > > case Value1 of > PATTERN1 -> > case Value2 of > PATTERN2 -> > this; > _ -> > that > end; > _-> > that > end > > as > > case {Value1, Value2} of > {PATTERN1, PATTERN2} -> > this; > _-> > that > end Not acceptable. This evaluates Value2 unconditionally. The original evaluates it only if Value1 matches PATTERN1 (think about side effects and runtime). The names Value1 and Value2 were misleading. Think about Expr1, Expr2. > * Regarding > fun(Arg) when ?MATCH(PATTERN1,Arg) or ?MATCH(PATTERN2,Arg) -> > I'm not sure why you want to match Arg against two patterns.().

    "context": "One of Australia\u2019s most successful fund managers, Peter Morgan, recently tweeted: \u201cMost underrated thing about being a fund manager = discipline.\u201d\nDiscipline is the process of sticking to your strategy without wavering. Discipline is holding your emotions in check. When it comes to bitcoin, it\u2019s hard not to be caught up in the hype and noise, whether it\u2019s justified or not.\nThere are a lot of buzzwords used in tandem with bitcoin, one of which is blockchain. To be fair, blockchain is more than a buzzword as it\u2019s a technology that appears here to stay (but there is still an element of uncertainty to it). Blockchain is a technology that, among other things, allows for faster and cheaper exchange of assets, whereas bitcoin is the traded asset class (a digital currency). Bitcoin is an asset class in potentially uncharted territory, and the uncharted territory looks set to only continue now that shorting has begun.\nAs of the beginning of this week, people can now invest or punt on the future value of bitcoin. You can go long (\u201cbullish\u201d that it will continue to go up) or short (\u201cbearish\u201d that the price will go down). As I mentioned earlier this brings further unknowns to an already unknown asset class, as previously you could only buy it to go \u201clong\u201d. If the bulls are right, it will become a legitimate asset class of the future, potentially rivalling gold as an asset class. However, if the bears are correct, it\u2019s possible that bitcoin will go the way of the tulips \u2013 in 1636 a single tulip bulb cost 10 times the annual wage in the Netherlands; in 1637 the tulip bubble burst and \u201cinvestors\u201d lost a fortune.\nFollowing on from the example of The Netherlands in the 1630s, in more recent times we\u2019ve seen a bubble burst on the back of shorting. In The Big Short, before the US housing market bubble burst, the bears (or the people wanting to short the market) needed an instrument to allow them to take the other side of the market. The resulting instrument \u2013 known as collaterised debt obligations or CDOs \u2013 allowed the bears to finally have their claws and short the market. It still took a while for the bubble to burst despite the creation of CDOs, so we still don\u2019t know what the short term of bitcoin looks like even if this theory proves to be correct. There are no guarantees that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now with bitcoin but, as Mark Twain once said, \u201cHistory doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes\u201d.\nWhen it comes to investing, the important thing isn\u2019t always how big your circle of competence is, but having the discipline to know what is in that circle and what is not. At Six Park, we\u2019re happy to sit on the sidelines with bitcoin. We know for sure that bitcoin has made many people rich but, more importantly, we know that it has the capacity to create catastrophic damage to investors\u2019 portfolios that could take decades to recover, if they recover at all. This is a risk that we don\u2019t think investors should take. At Six Park our investment philosophy is to stick to a proven approach of prudent asset allocation, risk management and keeping costs low to provide returns for our customers.\nAt a time when volatility is exceptionally low around the world in most asset classes, bitcoin is bucking that trend with jaw-dropping volatility. Volatility should never be ignored as it\u2019s inextricably related to risk. On this note I\u2019d like to finish with this joke that I saw about bitcoin highlighting its volatility. Who knows what one bitcoin will be worth tomorrow? We prefer to stay disciplined and stick to what we know best.\nA boy asked his bitcoin-investing dad for one bitcoin for his birthday.\nDad: What? $15,554??? $14,354 is a lot of money! What do you need $16,782 for anyway?\u201d\nTo invest using super, you will need a self managed super fund (SMSF). Are you looking to set up an SMSF?Create a new SMSF",

    "context": "The Martian review\nDo you remember when you used to go to gigs, get drunk and then, due to situations beyond your control, you ended up missing the last bus/train/ having no money for a cab and being stuck in some horrible town centre waiting for a rescue from mom/dad/or the morning bus? That is pretty much what happens to Mark Watney (Matt Damon) in The Martian.\nBoth Mars, and Ridley Scott have been subjects of press speculation over the last week or so. As I write this, NASA are preparing a press conference to make a major announcement about the \u201cRed Planet\u201d \u2013 I am guess on something to do with water\u2026 Last week Ridley Scott was staking his claim to some serious plot-losing with a series of garbled interviews about his Alien prequel Prometheus and its many parts and something to do with the poet Milton\u2026\nThe Martian blurs that line between did happen and could happen. It offers a more plausible scenario than Gravity and steps up the visual engagement from Apollo 13. For a good length of the movie we are focussed on Watney and his methodical approach to a potentially insurmountable problem. This could be the point at which the whole film falls apart, and yet it doesn\u2019t. Scott, the director is a very capable world-builder. He may not get it 100% every time (as many of Prometheus\u2018 detractors will attest) but here he gives us Mars, the red/dead planet, as a challenge. There are no alien threats, and no hints at monsters lurking behind doors. The threat here is the enormity of the challenge. The fear is the lack of anything beyond ingenuity and human perseverance to survive.\nMatt Damon has spoken about his lack of desire to play the traditional hero, instead preferring to be the character to whom things happen. He is a good choice of actor for Watney and he plays it with an endearing subtlety of touch. That is not to say that he is boring \u2013 far from it, we get characterisation through the use of video-logging (with some good product placement for go-pro\u2026)\nLike a lot of Ridley Scott films, the focus is on the human spirit and the reactions to situations that define us. There is the conflict of logical action versus the emotional need which shifts slowly through the film, especially in the representation of the NASA ground crew.\nThe Martian has a strong cast beyond Damon; Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mackenzie Davis shine out as the heart of the space program in Mission Control.\nAt nearly 2 1/2 hours, this is not a short movie. It sustains your interest throughout and the pacing is spot on. The 3D is not painful and doesn\u2019t play at depth for depth sake.\nShould you go?\nHaving only read reviews of the source material book (by Andy Weir) which grumble about the lack of action, I would say that this is not an issue with The Martian as a film. It is a pretty tense ride \u2013 interspersed with dialogue which never drops into the hack.\nIt takes between 150 and 300 days to reach Mars.

And when such a gorgeous venue is taken to the next level with the gorgeous floral design of Mum Floral Design - it all makes for a to die for affair. Angela & Evan Photography captured every moment so we could spend the afternoon getting inspired by all the pretty, and you can see it all in the full gallery of images!\nFrom the Bride... John and I met at a friend's wedding in September 2007, where John was a groomsman. He was so adorable in his tux that I could not resist asking him to dance. Nearly four years later, John proposed on the balcony of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, B.C, and of course, I said \u201cyes.\u201d On one of our early dates John and I went wine tasting in Woodinville, Washington, and happened to witness the arrival of a wedding party at Novelty Hill Januik Winery. John remembers saying, \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll get married here.\u201d To which I, trying not to tip my hand too early, replied, \u201cNo way.\u201d But when the time came to pick a venue, Novelty Hill Januik was the perfect location. Not only was it in Woodinville, where John grew up, and just a few miles from Seattle where I grew up, but it reminded us of all the fun times we had already shared ... oh, and the wine is really tasty! With the indispensable help of Novelty Hill\u2019s wedding coordinator Emily Pollock, we set about organizing a ceremony and reception that was laid-back but highlighted the modern beauty and intimacy of the winery. The winery\u2019s modern but warm feel were the inspiration for the day. All of the stationery was ordered through Costco and then embellished by me and my mom. We wrapped the raised print pocket fold invitations with a belly band of yellow and gold paper and then tied them with blue satin ribbon. We really wanted our guests to feel like they were opening a present when the invitation arrived.\nI had always dreamed of a fall wedding, and Novelty Hill\u2019s garden area, lined with trees and leaves changing color, really made the day feel like fall. All I had to say to Meghan Stoller of Mum Floral Design was \u201dI love succulents,\u201d and Meghan went about creating some of the most beautiful bouquets and arrangements I have ever seen. She was even able to incorporate a handkerchief, given to John at his birth, and my grandmother\u2019s rosary into the handle of the my bouquet. To top off her attention to detail, Meghan located the paper my mom and I had used on the invitations and wrapped it around the boxes the flower girls carried down the aisle. The ceremony was performed by Judge Tabor, one of my former bosses and mentor. His ceremony brought everyone to tears \u2014 several times. Having someone so dear perform the ceremony, while being surrounded by our friends and family, really made the day special and focused on our expression of love and commitment to each other.\nAfter the ceremony, guests enjoyed a wine and tray-passed hors d'oeuvres period before the dinner buffet was opened, where they were served a delicious meal of locally-sourced vegetables, salmon, and beef tenderloin. For a late night snack, the kitchen re-opened and guests were served wood-fired pizzas. We wanted our guests to spread out and mingle, so we decided to forgo place cards and instead decided to use a mix of small, large and tall tables. We used the mantel above the open fireplace to display photographs of our family members who could not join us. And instead of a guest book, we asked our guests to sign their names to a wedding tree, which we plan to hang in our entry way. John is a huge Star Wars fan. During the planning process he would frequently ask, \u201cWhen do we get the Leia and Han cake toppers?\u201d So I knew he would be floored when he saw the Millennium Falcon groom's cake I ordered. Mike\u2019s Amazing Cake\u2019s did not disappoint. Not only was the Millennium Falcon\u2019s detail spot on (reportedly the only cake to make the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs), the chocolate with salted caramel filled cake was delicious. Angela and Evan, married photographers, captured every detail and moment of the day to perfection. People danced until the very end of the night, and when we finally left the reception, we knew that this had been our perfect day.\nWedding Photography: Angela & Evan Photography / Wedding Venue + Catering: Novelty Hill Januik Winery in Woodinville, Washington / Day of Wedding Coordination: Emily Pollock of Novelty Hill Januik Winery / Floral Design: Meghan Stoller of Mum Floral Design / Officiant: Judge Gary Tabor / Marriage Certificate Calligraphy: Pascale Collins (pascalligraphy@gmail.com) / Wedding Invitations: DIY by the Bride & Her Mother via Costco / Wedding Cake: New Renaissance Cakes / Groom's Cake: Mike\u2019s Amazing Cakes / Entertainment: DJ DK of Pro DJs / Guest Book: Absinthe Custom Print / Cafe Lights: Blue Danube Productions / Chair Rentals: AA Party Rentals / Transportation: The Westin Bellvue / Umbrella Rentals: Bella Umbrella / Wedding Dress: Vera Wang via Marcella\u2019s La Boutique / Bride\u2019s Shoes: Christian Louboutin / Bride\u2019s Pearls: Mikimoto / Bride's Wedding Band: Guy Mamiya Custom Jewelers / Bridesmaids\u2019 Dresses: J.Crew / Hair + Makeup: Gene Juarez / Bridesmaids' + Flower Girl Belts: DIY by the Bride / Bridesmaids' Gifts: Tiffany & Co. / Men\u2019s Tuxedos: Men\u2019s Wearhouse / Groom's Wedding Band: Ben Bridge / Rehearsal Dinner: Willows Run Golf Course",

    "context": "The agricultural policy in the European Union (EU) involves one of the biggest financial transactions in the annual budget. This calls for a careful and precise registration of those farmers eligible to receive subsidies, plus the amount they are entitled to.\nBy: Massimo Pagani EMEA Executive Director Hexagon Geospatial\nIn order to make this registration work smoothly, a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) has been designed.\nEach country in the European Union manages and operates their own LPIS. For the Netherlands, this is done by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which includes the former Ministry of Agriculture.\nEach year, all current 70,000 farmers in the Netherlands must log into the system to declare which parcels they have used, what they\u2019ve grown and, if needed, modify their parcel boundaries. The declaration period is constrained to six weeks, and many farmers wait until the last weekend to submit their data. This results in peak usage in these final days. In order to properly respond to this surge, the application must be fast and reliable at all times.\nThe system supporting LPIS in the Netherlands was initially conceived in 2008, and involved a complex architecture of federated databases and geospatial servers. Keeping up performance and reliability is critical in such circumstances, especially at peak times, with a large part of the load coming from the underlying imagery data.\nThis is why the Ministry approached Imagem, the Benelux distributor for Hexagon Geospatial.\nERDAS APOLLO Imagery Service Operational in 1.5 Hours\nPutting in place a powerful imagery service based on ERDAS APOLLO was something Imagem has done on many occasions. In this case, the additional challenge was to implement within an existing architecture based on Esri technology. With no room to modify front end or back end architecture, the solution needed to slide neatly into place, and it needed to be done fast. When the order came in, there was a mere four weeks until the start of the submission period.\nUpon arriving onsite, the base system was made operational within 1.5 hours. The ability for ERDAS APOLLO to deploy a native Esri Geoservices protocol meant the front-end could directly take in the new service, without recoding. Furthermore, testing could begin almost immediately after installation. After implementation, the imagery appeared on screen even faster than the vectors, which proved the system could provide imagery data fast and work well within the given architecture..\nPerforming Under Pressure\nWhen the system went into production and farmers began submitting, the solution proved not only to be very fast, but also very stable. Even at peak times, with over 8 million page views and 100 GB of data being requested each hour, CPU\u2019s running APOLLO would not exceed even 25 percent of their maximum load.\nFurthermore, the data was now coming from a few large ECW mosaics, instead of a large, predefined tile cache that had been in use before. This meant that on top of the gain in speed and stability, data management was significantly reduced, as well as the amount of storage space required.\nIn conclusion, the Ministry is very satisfied with the solution and the ease with which it was implemented. Furthermore, this successful LPIS implementation paves the way to make use of this architecture for other systems as well.\nIt also proves that adopting a combined \u2018best of breed\u2019 approach to your system architecture can sometimes yield a better return on investment than standardizing on a single platform.\nAbout the Author:\nMassimo Pagani is the Executive Director for Europe, Middle East and Africa for Hexagon Geospatial.

    "context": "Dead mystery child dumped in suitcase in Australia\nThe skeletal remains of a young child have been found dumped in bushland in southern Australia, with police Thursday looking for an elderly man seen carrying a suitcase in the area.\nSuperintendent Des Bray told reporters the dead child, whose sex has not been determined and is believed to have been aged between two and seven, was likely killed elsewhere.\nHe said the body was stuffed in a suitcase and left alongside the Karoonda Highway, 130 kilometres (81 miles) east of Adelaide, some four to six weeks ago.\nBy the time it was found by a passing motorist on Tuesday, the remains were about two metres away from the bag.\n\u201cThe child was originally in the suitcase and at some point, somebody has, we believe removed the child from the suitcase,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what happened, and why, but we know for certain that somebody has come, found the suitcase, opened it to have a look what was in there, tipped out the contents and at that stage become aware that it was most likely human remains.\u201d\nPolice said it appeared that someone had pulled the suitcase from where it had originally been dumped and placed it in full view of the road.\n\u201cIt was right in the open and easily able to be seen,\u201d Bray said.\nOther items were found but police have not revealed what they were as they searched the area and door knocked homes in the nearby small town of Wynarka.\nBray said they were looking for a neatly-dressed man, aged about 60, who was seen at Wynarka walking towards the highway some weeks ago carrying a suitcase early one morning.\n\u201cWe have no description of the clothes he was wearing but he was carrying a dark-coloured suitcase in one hand\u2026 he was not a local,\u201d he added in comments carried by the ABC.\n\u201cThere would not be many people walking around Wynarka carrying a suitcase at 7:30am in the morning.\u201d\nA post-mortem was being conducted on the body as authorities appealed for information.\n\u201cSomebody must know somebody where a child has disappeared in suspicious circumstances,\u201d Bray said.\n\u201cSo we would encourage people to have a think about family, friends, acquaintances, people who live near them, perhaps somebody who has had concerns about children who live nearby and how they might be treated, and all of sudden a child\u2019s gone missing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for someone not to know.\u201d",

    "context": "The start of a university year is exciting for both the new student and those returning to college. Yet far too few plan their finances and the sudden demands on their money can mean poor decisions are made.\nThe three financial essentials are to make a budget, start a current account and ensure adequate insurance is in place.\nOnce the euphoria of the confirmed place calms down, check the accommodation costs as few students wish to follow the constrained conditions shown in Channel 4\u2019s Fresh Meat, even if earlier generations saw that as a rite of passage. Many expect en-suite bedrooms, on-site gyms and even a games room.\nLondon is the most expensive city with average weekly rents of \u00a3306.94, up 25 per cent in five years, according to estate agent JLL. It predicts a further four per cent rise in 2018. Knight Frank, another agent, says there are 76,383 purpose-built student beds in London, an increase of only 398 this year, which is far short of the number needed.\nAnnual tuition fees can reach \u00a39,250 after being capped at \u00a39,000 since 2012.\nWatch the cost of borrowing. The Student Loans Company will charge 6.1 per cent this autumn, up from 4.6 per cent last year. The rate is based on inflation, using the Retail Prices Index (RPI) in March plus three per cent, even though the Office for National Statistics has called the RPI \u201cflawed\u201d as it is usually higher than the more accurate Consumer Prices Index.\nSuch loans accrue interest on a daily basis immediately and so only apply for the sum really required.\nAfter graduation, students refund their loans on a sliding scale which depends on their earnings. Currently repayments start when a graduate\u2019s earnings reach \u00a321,000. Nine per cent of income above that threshold is liable which means that a graduate earning \u00a325,000pa will repay \u00a3360 annually. Employers will deduct this sum through the payroll whilst self-assessment tax returns can be used for the self-employed. Loans unpaid after 30 years are wiped off.\nA maintenance loan is available for full-time students to assist in the costs of accommodation, travel and food. It is means-tested and based on parental income. The loan can be up to \u00a38,430pa for students living away from home (increased to \u00a311,002 for studying in London) and \u00a37,292pa for those who continue to live at home.\nEven students whose parents\u2019 combined annual incomes are \u00a362,187 or more are entitled to one of these loans and can borrow up to \u00a33,928 outside London or \u00a35,479 within.\nCheck on bursaries available which may be linked to your home town or city, and is often related to the subject to be studied. Quite often universities have funds which assist those who have shown academic or sporting prowess or where the family background is unusual. A good online source is The Scholarship Hub whilst it is also worth enquiring through local reference libraries.\nAfter taking loans into account, there is likely to be a significant gap in the budget for daily costs. This is where a helpful current account comes into play. Look for a bank or building society with both a well-informed money advisor and a low or nil cost overdraft facility. This is far more important that a short-term gift.\nInterest-free student overdrafts up to \u00a33,000 are available from Barclays, HSBC, Halifax (with a bank licence provided by Bank of Scotland, forming part of Lloyds Banking Group) and Nationwide (the largest building society). The same facility but up to \u00a32,000 is offered by Lloyds, NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland and Spanish-owned Santander.\nThe length of facility varies with several banks increasing the sum available as the course proceeds. Several extend or increase the overdraft for longer courses such as architecture, medicine and veterinary.\nEnsure the limit is not exceeded as penal rates, often accompanied by fees, apply if more than the authorised sum is withdrawn. If there is a problem, see the specialist advisor immediately.\nFor periods when a student is likely to be in credit, such as perhaps summer employment, open a savings account. If it is linked to the current account, the provider is likely to look favourably upon a request for help, notably upon graduation.\nWhen budgeting, do not overlook a television licence. This is required to watch or download BBC, even using iPlayer. The annual fee is \u00a3147 which can be paid weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually. A refund can be applied for in respect of unused months when away from student accommodation.\nThieves target students, particularly in their first weeks at university when doors and windows are often left unlocked. Make a total list of all likely items to be taken from home and allow for new purchases, such as sports equipment and scientific items. Do not overlook expensive gadgets from laptops and cameras to mobile phones.\nMark as much as possible with your name and postcode and photograph any individual items of value. The local police can give advice. The home contents policy usually allows a certain amount to be outside the property but check on the overall limit, the single article restriction (such as for jewellery) and length of time which may not be 12 months.\nInsurers do not usually protect for time away from college unless the property is locked. With many universities letting out their premises in vacations, a student bedroom is likely to be used by someone else. If the contents is placed in a general store where many have access, an insurer will withdraw liability.\nAsk your current home insurer for advice as it may have an extension clause or alternative student policy available. Consider paying a slightly higher premium to reduce the excess. Some student current accounts come with insurance but this is unlikely to cover higher value articles such as a necklace or watch, camera or bicycle.\nKeep original receipts. One well-known insurer, represented on almost every university campus, insists on such evidence before it will consider any claim. A credit card or bank statement is insufficient.\nLook for student discounts. A Railcard for 16-25 year olds costs \u00a330pa or \u00a370 for three years and discounts off-peak journeys by a third. A free four year one is given by Santander when opening its student account. An additional discount is offered by some rail companies for online purchases using an NUS Extra card, which costs \u00a312pa.\nFor coach travel, National Express gives one-fifth discount for tickets bought three or more days ahead. Some bicycle manufacturers, such as Raleigh, and retailers will give student discounts, often up to 10 per cent on production of a NUS card.",

There is no evidence that the postcard passed through the mail (Figure 2).\nMy research of this postcard was totally unrewarding. A long distance call and several emails to Allan Tompkins, President of the Barham, N.S.W./ Kondrook, Victoria, Historical Society led to a deluge of valuable information about this event. In one of his emails Allan Tompkins stated that \"I can confirm that the \u2018play\u2019 was actually a fund raiser for the war effort (WWI) - more of a pageant to honour the various Queens and to crown the top money maker.\"\nThe local Barham paper had a comprehensive entry headed \u2018BARHAM CORONATION CEREMONY\u2019 followed by the request: \u2018(We have been requested by the ladies of the Barham Red Cross Society, to insert the following).\u2019 What follows has been extracted from a much longer paper, as follows:\n\"This Royal celebration was produced with great spectacular effect, in the Barham School of Arts on Wednesday evening July 19th, to a crowded house, and one of the most appreciative and interested audiences , that has ever occupied the large and commodious building....As the time drew near for the ceremony to begin, hundreds of expectant eyes eagerly watched the raising of the curtain... to witness the grand ceremony...The Barham orchestra with its well organised players opened with the National Anthem. This orchestra proved a most agreeable surprise as many had not known of its existence, and great credit is due to the success of the various selections played, and the able assistance given by the many artists during the evening...The orchestra played its first selection (as) the curtain rose on a scene which ever will remain a gratifying pleasure in the memory of those who were fortunate enough to witness it\".\n\"The scenic effects were produced by our local artist (Joe Bruscha) was grandly descriptive of the royal throne room, with its massive pillars, and beautiful ruby plush curtains fringed with heavy gold fringe, and held in position by gold cord and tassels. To a slow march played very softly by the orchestra, entered two handsome pages clad in ruby velvet wearing white hats with beautiful plumes to match. Slowly and solemnly they approached the centre of the stage, separating to allow the Queens and retinue to pass between them\".\n\"To the same strain came the two trumpeters in costumes in brown and gold tunics, with brown tights, caps of purple velvet with plumes at side, who marched to the front of the stage blowing fanfare of trumpets, during which the Herald advanced, in a rich costume of green satin, lacings of red silk cord, white gauntlet gloves, hat with plume, and announced the first Queen (Mrs. McConnell) Queen of the Golden Fleece. The approach of this matronly dame, who carries her years with such dignity and grace, and of whom her supporters were truly proud, was the cause of a great ovation.\"\nThis was followed by a long description of her costume: she had a train of gold plush held by two youthful train bearers, a girl and a boy both having the McConnell surname, whose costumes were also described, and following the pages were two maids of honour. All walked to the front of the stage where the Queen made a courtly bow to the audience, and she retired to one of the thrones, where she sat in state.\n\"Then followed a recital of \u2018Kitchener\u2019 by Miss E. Dalton of Koondrook, also a second selection by the orchestra, and a tableaux \"The Gleaner\" with lime light effect represented by six little girls\". There was a concealed chorus of girls who sang the \u2018gleaners song\u2019 which proved a most suitable tableaux for the Queen of the Golden Fleece.\n\"The Herald then announced the Queen of Public Service and Oddfellows Lodge (Miss R. Chanter)\" and this young and enchanting Queen\u2019s extravagant gown was extensively described.\nThe Herald then announced the third Queen, Miss G. McPherson, Queen of Commerce, and the whole procedure was repeated, and was followed by a song by Miss O\u2019Donnell \u2018The Rosary\u2019, and the performance of this talented artist received loud applause. This was followed by selections from the orchestra as tableaux, including those of patriotic appeal, \u2018Britannia Rules the Waves\u2019, \u2018Man of War\u2019 and \u2018Britannia\u2019. A miniature \"Man of War\u2019 ship, also an engine and trucks made by one of our boys (J. Elliott) completed the effect. \u2018The Heroes of Anzac\u2019 tableaux with lime light effect was most appropriate to the present war time and appealed to public sympathy. Then followed the crowning ceremony with announcement of the votes by Mr. Scobie M.L.A. (acting as mayor of Barham), as follows:\nQueen of the Golden Fleece 44,607\nQueen of the Public Service and Oddfellows Lodge 26,994\nQueen of Commerce 12,399\nTotal number 84,000\nProceeds of the competition \u00a3350\nAmid loud applause the winning Queen rose from her throne and bowed her acknowledgment and she was arrayed in her royal robes by her maids of honour. The Archbishop Rev. Stowards performed the crowning ceremony, and read the proclamation.\n\"The noble and fitting climax to the evening\u2019s entertainment\" was a complete surprise to me for Miss O\u2019Donnell sang the Russian Anthem.\nPrior to the conclusion, a Miss V. O\u2019Donnell of Bendigo, one of Melba\u2019s pupils sang and gave a beautiful rendering of \u2018Theres a Land\u2019, which was encored.\nA map of a small segment of the mighty Murray River shows Barham, New South Wales and Koondrook, its smaller sister town in Victoria, is seen in Figure 3.\nThis border area between the two States is believed to have been occupied by the indigenous Wemba-Wemba people prior to white settlement. The 114,656 acre \u2018Barham\u2019 station ws taken up in 1843 by Edward B. Green, who named it after the maiden name of his wife. The Barham Koondrook Bridge opened in October 1904, and this landmark lift-bridge is still in use (Figure 4).\nBarham is now the Wakool Shire\u2019s largest centre and has a current population of around 1200 residents. Barham and its twin, Koondrook, to-day obtain their main industries from cattle, fat lamb, dairying, timber and tourism. Barham is 860 kilometer south-west of Sydney.",

    "context": "A Chili's parking lot in Florida marked the beginning of a tragedy Sunday evening when a local man attacked his wife, then picked up his two young children from the babysitter's and shot them before turning the gun on himself, Seminole County deputies reported.\nThe sequence of events began when the suspect, 30-year-old Henry Brown, hid in his estranged wife's trunk until she left the restaurant. Records indicate that their marriage had been rocky ever since his wife, 31-year-old Chericia Brown, had an injunction issued in January following a domestic battery report from the month before.\nUpon leaving the restaurant around 10 p.m., Chericia was rushed by Henry, who had been lying in wait, and stabbed multiple times. The attack prompted a nurse and paramedic, who were dining at the establishment, to come and help, but that's when Henry returned to the scene in a bid to finish the job by running her over - and hitting the two good Samaritans in the process.\nAfterward, Henry drove to Alamonte Springs and changed vehicles to a Ford F250. While there, he also picked up his two children - a 1-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son - from the babysitter.\nWith the two in tow, he headed to Central Florida Regional Hospital in search of his wife, but security and witnesses recognized him, prompting him to pull out his gun and open fire on law enforcement and security personnel in an attempt to flee. Deputies said they returned fire, but were unable to prevent him from fleeing to Interstate 4.\nHe drove westbound along the interstate, eventually being discovered by police near the Seminole-Volusia county line just minutes later. Deputies successfully used stop sticks to slow Henry's vehicle down, but upon closing in to arrest him, they found him as well as his two children dead inside.\nInvestigators said they believe Brown killed his children at some point after picking them up, then committed suicide while police prepared to apprehend him.\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, at some point during the night, Chericia died at the hospital from her injuries.\nI-4 near the St. Johns River Bridge was shut down for hours after the incident, but has since reopened.\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting at the hospital.",

I would have been running with Suzanne, my running partner. What would the calf do???\nAt the 2am Norman the choc lab potty time, my calf was talking to me in an angry voice and I made the decision to not run. This morning's stumble to the coffee maker confirmed the decision. Bummer but I know that I would have hurt myself more and possibly would have had to ride the golf cart of shame. Got up early anyway and drove two friends down to the metro station so they could ride the train to the start line, and they are still running now. Hope you guys are having a good run and enjoying the scenery.\nMeanwhile, Norman, HJG, and Mrs. RTP made our way through our neighborhood to catch the elites.\nThe course passed about 1/2 mile north of our house. It was overcast and about 50 degrees --perfect. After watching the wheelchair racers go by\nwe had a short wait and then the elite men came by in a flash. Awesome!!\nA bit more of a wait and the first women came by just flying\nand then there started the amazing field of fast runners men and women. This was truly fun to watch and made me wish I was out there. I am determined to work this calf back into 20-25 mile weeks and build endurance this year. Had some fun tweets with Lauren and Adam this morning. I guarantee we will be running some trail races and possibly some bi/tri crap this year. I am posted for the Runners Den pancake fun run next weekend, which is designed to be a fun recovery run for those who did the RnR today. Just got a tweet from Suzanne who finished in 2:12!!

    "context": "(Image from the internet \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to source images yet\u2026)\nSince the conception and inception of this blog, I have not really had a plan for it. I\u2019ve had a dream of creating a community where people share life together, but no plan of how to do that. So for a year or so, I have been writing, blogging, sharing in random intervals with no real guiding direction or overarching plan. No road map.\nThat is pretty much how I live my whole \u2013 no real plan, just taking things as they come and trying to work it out. I have values that guide me, but no real plan. Anybody with an ounce of common sense will say that isn\u2019t a great or successful way to live life. (I know!) It sure makes me susceptible to the currents of the world, being tossed about in life like a wave in the sea (see James 1). I married a planner though, so it still works for me. Thank God for my husband. Seriously. Thank you.\nAlso, as many of you know, I am in the process of writing a few fiction novels. The beauty of writing novels is I can just sit and write (the term is \u2018pantsing\u2019) without planning. It\u2019s how my brain works. It\u2019s the beauty of the revision process. I don\u2019t NEED a plan to write a story. However, if my goal is to create a real-life community, \u2018no plan\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it. I can\u2019t pants my way into an online community. It has to be intentional. On purpose. Planned.\nSo, this is PART of my plan. The only part I know about right now anyway.\nStep 1: Figure out how to create a community\nHow do I create a space where people share part of their lives with each other? A place where a quick button click doesn\u2019t ever feel like enough. Where one is prompted to engage, to type words, to share. Perhaps I need to engage more with those who already read my blog. Perhaps I need to start there and begin to not only read but comment on the blogs of others? I feel like \u201cI don\u2019t have time\u201d for that, but if it\u2019s important, we make time, right? Just like reading. Just like writing. Just like yoga.\nI think you get the picture.\nFor now, I am going to commit to reading and commenting more on the blogs of people around me already (that includes you guys! yay!). I\u2019m not sure how good I\u2019ll be or how often I\u2019ll manage reading, but I\u2019m going to give it a try anyway.\nStep 2: Figure out how to connect my blog with my facebook page in a meaningful way.\nHow do I generate conversation, invite discussion, share life? I don\u2019t really know how to do that yet, but I think I might have a trick or two up my sleeve. And they aren\u2019t gimmicks. I want to engage with some thought provoking questions, perhaps. Or\u2026other\u2026things\u2026 that get people to talk. Clearly I have research to do. Perhaps questions that relate to whatever I\u2019ve written lately. Or something interesting I read of someone else\u2019s. I don\u2019t know. Something.\nMaybe this will work. Maybe it won\u2019t. Maybe everyone has all the community they\u2019re looking for.\nBut then again, maybe they don\u2019t.\nMaybe someone is looking for a community where he can reach out and others reach back. Maybe someone could use a little more positivity in her life.\nI know that I\u2019m no Rachel Martin or Becky Thompson or Jen Hatmaker, but I don\u2019t need to be. I. Don\u2019t. Need. To. Be (repeating for my benefit, not yours). Even so, we can still have community together. It can still be meaningful.\nSo friends, are you game? Are you up for taking a little journey together? Are you up for seeing where this goes and what happens?\nI am. I hope you are too. I am really looking forward to what this next step will look like.\nSo, if you haven\u2019t already, hop on over to facebook and check it out over there. I\u2019m going to try to have some interesting questions next week that will relate to the post I hope to have up on Monday. It\u2019s in my head, just not written down yet.",

Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook the clams just until they start to open, 4-6 minutes.

Remove from the pan, and finely chop when cooled.\nIn the pan with the bacon fat, add butter and melt it. Add the red pepper, shallots, garlic, and oregano and saut\u00e9 until the shallots are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and simmer until it is almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.\nRemove the skillet from the heat and cool completely. Stir the chopped pancetta and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese into the vegetable mixture. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.\nLine a heavy large baking sheet with foil. Remove the top shell from the clams, and carefully separate the clam from the bottom shell, with a clam or paring knife. Arrange the clams on the baking sheet.\nSpoon the vegetable mixture atop the clams, dividing equally and mounding slightly. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan.\nBake until the clams are just cooked through and the topping is golden, about 10 minutes.\nNOTE: If the clams won\u2019t sit steadily on sheet pan for baking in the oven, spread a thick layer of kosher salt in the pan to stabilize the clams while cooking.",

    "context": "comparing Medicare advantage\nto Medicare supplement plans:\nWhat about Medicare Advantage?\nMedicare Advantage is an option for people on Medicare A&B. People always ask me how an insurance agent can offer them a Medicare Advantage plan with Zero premium? Well, how a Medicare advantage plan works is, when you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan, the program takes over as your primary insurer, and Medicare pays that company a monthly premium to take all your risk from Medicare and put it on that private insurance company. They send these companies a lot of money, several thousand dollars a year. So there are significant commissions in it for insurance agents. All that being said, you get what you pay for is an excellent quote for Medicare Advantage.\nThere are a lot of out of pocket expenses involved with Medicare advantage, cost sharing and co-pays for everything that you do. However, where most people struggle with advantage, is not having control over their health care.\nMost advantage plans nowadays are HMO (Health Maintenance Organizations) which means they manage your healthcare. There is nothing worse than being sick or having significant health conditions and being at the mercy of your insurance company for treatment. It is not uncommon to have to jump through several hoops and get many referrals before receiving any expensive treatment. Let\u2019s use an example, Mrs. Jones has Medicare A&B plus a Medicare supplement. Mrs. Jones goes to her doctor and the doctor says, Mrs. Jones, you\u2019re going to need a $40,000 surgery, well Mrs. Jones meets with her surgeon and in the next month gets her surgery, hopefully that solves her problem and she can move on with life. Now, Mrs. Jones has an HMO Medicare advantage plan, Mrs. Jones goes the doctor and again the doctor says, Mrs. Jones you need a $40,000 surgery, her advantage plan doesn\u2019t want to pay for it, so they send her to one of their \u201cin-network\u201d specialists, she meets with the specialist and the specialist says, before surgery, we should try physical therapy first ( so her advantage plan doesn\u2019t have to spend $40,000). Mrs. Jones tries Physical therapy for 2 months, it doesn\u2019t work, and 6 months down the road she ends up getting the same surgery she would have received had she had original Medicare plus a supplement. This is a scenario with just a simple surgery. When you develop serious Medicare conditions, Heart issues, Cancer, Respiratory issues, Kidney disease, anything where you\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of doctors and specialists, the HMO scrutiny becomes much more intense. The entire premise of an HMO advantage plan is to manage your health care to save the company money. The company considers it as keeping, you-the policy holder, from wasteful spending of the advantage plans money. As if receiving quality healthcare is wasteful spending.\nThe Real cost of Medicare advantage, is not being able to get good health insurance when you need it. Once you develop Medicare conditions and start having problems with a Medicare Advantage plan, you won\u2019t be able to return to original Medicare and purchase a Supplement. A Medicare Supplement must be purchased when you first start Medicare, or by passing underwriting with your good health. So, by the time most people realize how weak their health insurance is with Medicare Advantage, it is already too late, and they\u2019re stuck on the plan.\nAll that being said, with original Medicare and a Medicare supplement, you can go to any doctor or go to any hospital in the entire country, as long as they accept Medicare, you can go there. There is no managed care with Medicare either; you have control over your healthcare.",

    "context": "Our 7 Favorite Classic Lenses of All Time\nI\u2019ve shot thousands of pictures with hundreds of great lenses over the past 40+ years, but the following seven favorites.\nYou\u2019ll have a better idea of what makes each of them special when you read the detailed descriptions below, but even that is no substitute for shooting pictures. While these classic lenses are no longer in production, all can be found in the used departments of camera stores and on eBay, and all except one can be adapted to fit current digital cameras and camcorders.\nIndeed, many savvy shooters now use classic lenses like these for shooting art stills and vintage-look videos, which is one reason prices have crept up in recent years. But if you want to capture images that have that distinctive look, they\u2019re still a bargain and a great way to make your imagery stand out.\n1. 50mm f/2 Leitz Dual Range Summicron\nI got mine with my first Leica M3 and this 7-element chrome-finished beauty, produced from 1956 to 1968, delivers amazingly high resolution (over 100 lines/mm according to contemporary tests) along with excellent contrast and beautiful bokeh. It performs amazingly well even wide open, and spectacularly at its optimum aperture of around f/5.6 where it \u2018ll give any modern 50mm a run for the money.\nIcing on the cake: If you want to get closer than 27.5 inches, slide on the optical \u201cgoggles\u201d before you mount the lens and you can focus down to 19 inches with reasonable parallax compensation. The only downside: It won\u2019t mount on digital Leica Ms.\nPrice range: $1,000-1,500\n2. 35mm f/2 Leitz Summicron\nIntroduced in 1958 as an 8-element design that\u2019s still regarded as one of the best performing non-aspheric lenses ever, the current version is the Leica 35mm f/2 Summicron-M ASPH that uses a different formula. The one to look for is the older Type 4 introduced in 1979, a 7-element design known as the \u201cBokeh King\u201d because of its exquisite bokeh that\u2019s partly attributable to residual coma and astigmatism in the outer zones.\nDespite these minor defects it\u2019s a very sharp lens overall, especially in the center of the field. Frankly, any older 35mm f/2 Summicron will take beautiful pictures, but bokeh fanatics should look for the Type 4 with serial numbers in the 2,974,000-3,731.000 range.\nPrice range (all older types): $1,500-2,750\n3..\nPrice range: In F-mount, $100-250, In Nikon rangefinder S-mount, $200-$500\n5. 50mm f/1.5 Zeiss Sonnar\nThis iconic 7-element, 3-group high-speed normal lens was formulated by the legendary Zeiss optical designer Ludwig Bertele for the Contax l rangefinder camera and was released in uncoated form way back in 1932. It had the great advantage of minimizing air-glass surfaces and chromatic aberrations, and was produced in coated versions until the early 60s. It\u2019s sharp, has good contrast and a multi-bladed circular diaphragm enhances its inherently excellent bokeh, resulting in beautiful, luminous rendition.\nThe 50mm f/1.5 Sonnar was tweaked by Nikon to create the legendary 50mm f/1.4 Nikkor for Nikon rangefinder cameras, but I prefer the original Sonnar for its pictorial qualities. (Note: Not to be confused with the current more expensive Sonnar C in M-mount.)\nPrice range: In Contax rangefinder mount: $125-350\n6. 80mm f/2.8 Mamiya-Sekor\nThis is the two-lens interchangeable standard lens unit for Mamiya twin-lens reflex cameras and it\u2019s a real sleeper, delivering impressive image quality even at f/2.8 (except in the extreme corners of the field), outstanding sharpness, good contrast, and beautiful bokeh throughout its extended focusing range, especially when used for portraiture.\nA 5-element 3-group design similar to Leica\u2019s 90mm f/2.8 Elmarit provides excellent chromatic aberration correction and high resolution, but tends to flare in backlit situations\u2014the last \u201cblue dot\u201d multicoated versions are less prone to flare and ghosting. If you\u2019re tempted, go whole hog and get a Mamiya C330 camera complete with this lens for about $250-300.\nPrice range: Lens unit only, $100-200\n7. 105mm f.\nt\u2019s sharp even wide open, has superb color rendition, and creamy smooth bokeh\u2014which is why so many who own it, including me, include it on their short list of great vintage lenses.\nPrice range: $125-250\nAfter drooling over these great lenses, you might also want to take a look at our earlier pick of the top 10 lenses for mirrorless cameras.\n- Log in or register to post comments\n>)",

    "context": "How to Bet on a Live Horse Race\nThree Methods:Getting Betting InformationChoosing a HorsePlacing a WagerCommunity Q&A!\nSteps\n1\nGetting Betting Information\n- 1Purchase.\n- 2Buy a Daily Racing Form to read about past performances. Daily Racing Forms (DRFs) are produced by the racetrack to offer more information about the day\u2019s contestants. Purchase a DRF at the betting counter, which will provide you with records of past performances as well as handicapping. DRFs normally cost about $4 USD.[2]\n- Daily racing forms also include detailed articles about horse racing.\n- DRFs are produced daily, and are written specifically about the day's contestants.\n- 3Check a local newspaper for handicapper selections. Some newspapers cover events at the local racetrack. Check a local newspaper for handicappers\u2019 selections, which are sometimes published. Professional handicappers analyze the odds of a race to produce predictions about the outcome.[3]\n- Alternatively, racetracks often sell handicapping tips sheets for about $2 USD.\n2\nChoosing a Horse\n- 1Look at the horse\u2019s odds of winning. Look at the estimated odds of each horse winning the race. This will appear as a large number printed next to the horse\u2019s stats. Check out the horses\u2019 race records for a better indication of their winning ability.[4]\n- For instance, good odds for a horse might be 3-1 while long odds could be closer to 15-1. That means that the first horse has a 25% chance of winning, while the other horse only has a 6.25% chance.\n- If you bet $2 USD on a horse with 3-1 odds, you will win $8 USD. If you bet the same amount of a horse with 15-1 odds, you will win $32 USD.\n- 2View.[5]\n- 3Check.\n- 4Keep. Alternatively, visit the track from time to time without betting to see how the horses are performing.[6]\n- 5Look up racehorse pedigree information. A horse\u2019s genetic background may suggest that they\u2019ve inherited a winning characteristic, such as speed. Look up handicapping charts and pedigree information online to see if a racehorse is descended from other winning horses. A strong pedigree is a telling indicator of a horse\u2019s performance.[7]\n3\nPlacing a Wager\n- 1Set a betting budget.]\n- 2Place your bet at the betting window if you are at a racetrack. Go to the betting window and tell the clerk the number of the race you\u2019re betting on. Tell them how much you are betting, the type of wager, and the number of the horse as it is listed in the program. Be sure to check your betting ticket before leaving the window to correct any mistakes that might be on it.[9]\n- Automatic tellers are also available at some racetracks.\n- 3Place a bet online if you want to bet from home.]\n- 4\n- 5Bet on your horse \u201cplacing\u201d or \u201cshowing.\u201d Place a bet on your horse \u201cplacing\u201d (i.e., either winning or coming in second), which will increase your odds of winning. The payout will be less, but the risk of losing is also smaller. To make the bet even safer, bet on your horse \u201cshowing,\u201d which means you will get a payout if it comes in first, second, or third.[12]\n- 6Place an \u201cacross the board\u201d bet.]\n- 7Make an exotic wager. Unlike \u201cstraight\u201d wagers, \u201cexotic\u201d wagers involve multiple horses and very specific situations. These bets are often 3 or 4 times more expensive than simple bets and have lower odds, but hold the potential for a larger payout if you win. Choose your bet carefully and only go through with it if you have enough cash to handle a likely loss. Some examples of \u201cexotic\u201d bets are:[14]\n- A \u201cquinella\u201d bet, where your horses must finish first and second, in any order. This is the simplest \u201cexotic\u201d bet to place.\n- An \u201cexacta\u201d bet, where your horses must finish first and second in the specific order you choose.\n-. This is essentially a \u201cdaily double\u201d plus another didn't cash in my tickets - how can I find out if they are good or not?wikiHow ContributorUsually tickets expire after 12 months. Credits don't expire. You can look up race results online, or go back to track to find out and/or cash them in.\n- Can I make a $5 bet?wikiHow ContributorIt depends on where you go, every facility will have its own minimum betting requirement.\n- How much do I get if I win?wikiHow ContributorYou get your money back, and double the amount. For example, if you bet $100, you will turn in your money, and if you lose, you will not get it back, so you just paid $100. If you win, you get you $100 back, and $100 extra..\nTips\n- At the end of the day, take all of your vouchers to the cashier to receive your winnings in cash.\n- Plan on arriving at least half an hour before the race you want to bet on to familiarize yourself with the track.\nWarnings\n- Gambling can sometimes become an addiction and negatively affect your life. If necessary, seek help in dealing with this addiction.\nSources and Citations\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\n- \u2191\nMade Recently\nUpload a picture for other readers to see.\nArticle Info\nCategories: Games of Chance | Horse Racing\nIn other languages:\nEspa\u00f1ol: apostar en carreras de caballos en vivo, Deutsch: Bei einem Pferderennen wetten\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 115,591 times.",

Also is there any indication whether you\u2019re limited to a set menu of options with the package or if the full menu is available?

    "context": "Following the receipt of an apparently genuine e-mail from PayPal, users are asked to log in to their account and to provide their credit card information, ATM Pin included, on a fake PayPal web page.\n2010 opens with a phishing surprise for PayPal users. The mechanism behind it is simple and it aims two targets in one go: PayPal account and credit card information.\nFirst comes the fake official PayPal e-mail, which urges users to confirm their e-mail address and credit card information as part of a supposedly \"innovative\" means of monitoring \"inactive customers\" and \"non- functioning e-mail boxes\".\nAs usual, social engineering ingredients come in handy in this kind of messages. In this case, there are two elements which emphasize the urgency of the matter: a restriction and removal warning and a clear deadline, January 12.\nIf the reference to credit card information in this context does not ring an alarm bell, gullible users will take the second step of the furtive procedure and they will log in to their PayPal accounts. And that's a first strike, as the user name and password are typed on a fake PayPal page.\nThe third and final step takes users to a page where they are supposed to fill in various personal information, all in the name of standard security maintenance procedures: name, address, credit card number and the like. If the request to provide the credit card's ATM PIN, strategically placed last, does not raise any suspicion, the deal is sealed.\nOnce again, standard preventive measures will keep PayPal users safe from harm:\n\u2022Make sure you always activate or turn on your antiphishing or phishing filter, as well as any other security applications or suites before browsing to your e-banking account. Ideally, you should install, activate and update a reliable security solution.\n\u2022Double-check the URL of the page you are on, especially if you are required to fill in credit card information.\n\u2022Make sure that the e-banking Web site uses SSL encryption (Secure Socket Layer) and security authentication methods - look for the \"https\" prefix and the locked padlock. If you are requested to accept a certificate for the session, check that the name on the certificate matches the name of the institution you wish to deal with and that the certificate is signed by a known Certificate Authority such as ThawteTM or VeriSign\u00ae before accepting.\n\u2022NEVER disclose your PIN to anyone, under any circumstances.\n\u2022Avoid using a non-secured computer (like a friend's desktop or job colleague laptop). Still, if you are forced to do so, make sure you at least run BitDefender's advanced scanning on-line tool, Quick Scan, before proceeding.\n\u2022Do not check your e-banking account from public computers connected to Internet (like those in a library or Internet Caf\u00e9).\nWednesday, January 13, 2010",

If users follow the instructions, they log in to their PayPal accounts on a fake PayPal page, giving away their username and password. The final step takes users to a page where they are supposed to fill in various personal information, including their credit card's ATM PIN.",

The registry passively extracts electronic health record (EHR) data from rheumatology practices, aggregates and analyzes these data centrally, and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard.\nObjectives We used data from RISE to 1) examine variation in performance on quality measures across practices, and 2) evaluate trends in measure performance over time.\nMethods RISE's informatics platform continuously collects data from the EHRs of participating practices, allowing centralized aggregation and analysis of quality measures. We analyzed data collected between July 1, 2014-July 1, 2016 on all patients seen by 294 clinicians across 63 practices. Measures in the areas of rheumatoid arthritis, drug safety, preventive care and gout were examined. Performance on quality measures, defined as the percentage of eligible patients receiving recommended care, was examined at the practice level. To examine trends in performance over time, we took the subset of practices that continuously participated in RISE since its inception (n=44), and developed 1) control charts and 2) logistic regression models, in which the outcome was practice-level performance each month and the predictor was time.\nResults Data from 289,812 patients was examined. Mean (SD) age was 59 (16) years, 75% were female, 21% were racial/ethnic minorities, and 37% had public insurance. Most rheumatologists were in a group practice (73%); 25% were in solo practice and 2% part of a larger health system. Performance on measures varied significantly across practices (Table). The largest gaps were observed for gout and preventive care. For 4 of 5 measures for which the Medicare program has set national benchmarks, average performance of RISE practices exceeded targets. Of 11 measures, performance improved over time on 5 measures (p<0.05 in logistic models; see Figure for example control chart), was at goal on 4 measures, and saw no improvement on 2 measures (BMI screening and urate target).\nConclusions We found significant variation in performance on quality measures across RISE practices, with the largest gaps seen in gout care and preventive care. Some practices have achieved a very high level of performance. Over time, RISE practices demonstrated improvement in over half of the measures examined. As rheumatologists aim to improve quality of care, RISE will, by design, allow participants to measure, benchmark, and continuously monitor performance.",

    "context": "By Neal Morton\nCaption\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 Each time the Spurs win during the NBA playoffs, CST Brands Inc. rakes in the dough.\nFor seven years, the locally based company, formerly the retail arm of Valero Energy Corp., has offered a free cup of coffee at its more than 150 convenience stores in the area the morning after a Spurs playoff victory.\nIn 2007, more than 200,000 fans took advantage of the promotion. But last year, when the Spurs made the Finals, CST gave away more than 1 million cups of its private-label brew.\nDespite the giveaways, the promotion is lucrative for CST \u2014 customers seeking free coffee often buy kolaches, cigarettes and more while they're in the stores.\nThe deal also is exclusive. Indeed, Spurs Sports & Entertainment sought to protect its partnership with Valero by trying to talk Taco Cabana out of a similar offer a year ago.\n\u201cThe situation wasn't a real big deal,\u201d said Lawrence Payne, an executive vice president who handles corporate sponsorships for SS&E. \u201cWe agreed to disagree a little bit.\u201d\nTaco Cabana, also based in San Antonio, has had its own sponsorship with the Spurs since 1990 and even operates a restaurant at the AT&T Center.\nStill, its history with the Silver & Black didn't stop Payne from calling Todd Coerver, chief operating officer of Taco Cabana, when he found out the popular Mexican eatery offered customers a free breakfast taco the day after a Spurs win.\n\u201cIt's really extreme cases where we would want to formally go after anybody,\u201d Payne said. \u201cThat's kind of the last resort.\u201d\nWhile SS&E never sent Taco Cabana a formal cease-and-desist letter, Coerver said the team's representatives made it clear they wanted the promotion to end.\nThe fast-casual restaurant chain estimated it gave away nearly 20,000 breakfast tacos over the course of three days during the Finals last year.\nSS&E \u201casked us, out of respect for their promotional sponsorship opportunity with Valero, if we would kindly not participate or reconsider our\u201d free taco campaign, Coerver said.\nTaco Cabana, however, plans to once again offer free, post-victory tacos if the Spurs make the Finals this year.\nThis isn't the first time Taco Cabana irked a professional sports franchise.\nIn all of its Texas and Oklahoma markets, the company runs similar promotions when a city's team in any sport wins a national championship or makes it to the finals. Taco Cabana launched the program four years ago, during the Texas Rangers' first World Series.\nHowever, the Rangers sent Taco Cabana a cease-and-desist letter, according to an October 2010 post on the restaurant chain's Facebook page. Taco Cabana got around the formal complaint with some clever wording.\n\u201cWe just turned around and created unofficial names for the (team's) following,\u201d Coerver said. \u201cWe'd post something like, 'The boys in North Texas are taking the field tonight,' or 'If the home boys win. ... '\n\u201cIt wasn't about a formal sponsorship. It was about being fans ourselves and sharing that support.\u201d\nAnd like CST, the post-game celebration drives more customers and bigger purchases to Taco Cabana locations when it offers a free taco.\n\u201cNo one takes a trip to Taco Cabana and gets just one taco,\u201d Coerver said. \u201cThey'll add a coffee or juice and get a couple more (tacos) for coworkers. It's worth our while and just keeps the brand front and center in peoples mind.\u201d\nAt CST, executives said the breakfast crowd already provides its convenience stores with 80 percent of their daily business. But on days after the Spurs win, morning traffic increases at least 20 percent.\nCurrently, SS&E and Valero are hammering out the details of an extension to the energy company's long-standing sponsorship of the Spurs.\nPart of that agreement includes exclusive rights to offer post-win coffee, a privilege that Valero extended to CST after its spinoff last year.\nHal Adams, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for CST, said the company receives calls months in advance of the playoffs to confirm Corner Stores will continue to provide the free coffee.\nWhile he and a Valero spokesman would not discuss the Taco Cabana incident, Adams said CST \u201cabsolutely\u201d considers other free-food promotions as a threat.\n\u201cWe've done a good job in seeding this to the community, and we want to be the place where people come to celebrate victories during the playoffs,\u201d he said.\nFor now, Taco Cabana continues its promotion.\nBut Payne made it clear that doesn't represent a green light for other retailers hoping to cash in on the Spurs.\n\u201cTaco Cabana has been a long-standing partner,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnically, they were in the rules, and so we let it go with that.\n\u201cWe've invested a lot in our brand, and we've invested a lot in our whole team,\u201d Payne said. \u201cJust because people think they're participating in that \u2014 their hearts might be in the right place \u2014 but there are rules and regulations and instances where we have to ask them to stop.\u201d\nHowever, Seth Chandler, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, questioned the legal merits behind SS&E's stance. He doubted whether the team could stop any retailer from offering something for free after a victory.\n\u201cThe outcome of a sports game is just a fact,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cIt's no different if Taco Cabana offered free tacos when the temperature goes over 100 degrees.\u201d\n\u201cTo simply put into text, 'We will give you a free taco if the Spurs win,' that's not infringing on any trademark that I can think of or any intellectual property.\u201d\nWhile Chandler also acknowledged a Spurs sponsor such as Taco Cabana might not want to anger the team's management company, he also wondered why a free-food campaign would upset SS&E.\n\u201cHonestly, why wouldn't they just be happy that people are coming together to support the Spurs?\u201d Chandler asked.\nnmorton@express-news.net\nnmorton@express-news.net\nBusiness writer\n\u00a9",

The interactive singing competition \u201cRising Star\u201d was also a hit in its native Israel, but the much-hyped US version aired this summer on ABC to tepid viewer interest.\nMeanwhile, Keshet Media \u2014 the Israeli studio behind \u201cRising Star\u201d \u2014 formed a joint venture with Dick Clark Productions \u2014 Keshet DCP \u2014 to sell its formats in the States.\nUp next?

    "context": "Hello all and thanks in advance for any help!\nI have a 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid with 150k miles and all scheduled maintenance performed on-time. I have a Stop Safely Now light that started intermittently a little over a month ago and is now hard failed.\nThe first time it happened was 5 weeks ago and I had just returned from a trip out of the country and the vehicle sat 10 days without running. After starting the car I was able to drive about 20 feet at which time I stopped to connect bluetooth and the SSN message illuminated. My first thought was dead or dying battery since I have heard this could cause SSN. I jumped the car and drove without issue for the next two weeks.\nThen three weeks ago I got in the car after leaving it parked overnight and drove for about 10 feet before I got SSN. This time I decided to bite the bullet and buy a new 12V battery without testing the installed battery. After installing the new battery I still had the SSN light and I called it a night. Further research shows the 12V battery I removed assuming it was dead was only installed 3 years ago and is likely in serviceable condition.\nAfter letting the car sit overnight with the new 12V battery installed I started it in the morning with no problem and did the fuel trim learning game. I drove with the new battery for 3 weeks with no issues until last weekend.\nNow the car has the Stop Safely Now light illuminated on key turn and it will not move under its own power. I used my OBD2 reader to download codes twice.\nThe first set of codes was downloaded right after the battery change so I am assuming some of the codes are from that:\nC1600 - reverse input circuit\nC1015 - exhaust gas recirculation sensor B circuit high\nU3003 - battery voltage\nI cleared these codes after the battery change and I had no engine lights or driving issues until last weekend. I also checked the engineering fault code page on the dash after the battery change and I had no current or historic faults recorded.\nNow the car has a OBD2 code C1018 - regen braking and on the engineering fault code page it lists DTC C46200 as a historical fault. Keep in mind I am using a very basic OBD2 reader so it is likely missing some faults.\nI have been reading everywhere about the Stop Safely Now issue and it seems to stem from a number of different issues, the most frequent being a coolant pump. I could really use any advice in troubleshooting this issue myself (I am an aircraft mechanic) or relevant manual references. I am trying to avoid a costly stealership repair but I am pretty stuck at this point.\nWorth mentioning all of the fuses are in good shape!\nPlease let me know if you have any questions that would help point in the right direction.",

    "context": "\"I am just infinitely inspired by Basque cooking, Basque ingredients and the Basque landscape,\" says chef Alex Raij, who wrote The Basque Book with her husband, chef Eder Montero.\nShe also shared her recipes for Garlic Soup with Torn Salt Cod and Garden Snails in Bizka\u00edna Sauce.\n[More: Keeping the Basque tradition of cheesemaking alive]\nAmy Thielen: When I think about Basque food, I think of these Basque \u201cmateria prima,\u201d the prime materials. I\u2019m thinking about cod, red pepper, onions, garlic and jam\u00f3n serrano, that famous oily, prosciutto-like ham. What are the materials that make up Basque food? What does it mean to you?\nAlex Raij: They\u2019re fairly simple. What it means to me is more that the ingredients are a direct reflection of the landscape. The foods are highly recognizable. Then when you turn them into a dish, they still reflect the landscape.\nWhen I think about what are the hallmarks of Basque cuisine or what is it composed of, it is vegetables, lots of different kinds of lettuces; green on green is fairly common. It\u2019s the colors of the ikurri\u00f1a, the Basque flag, which are red, green and white. You end up with cod.\nAT: Cod is the white part?\nAR: Exactly. Salt cod and salt in general, and then any sort of white flesh fish. You think about peppers, both dried and fresh, and onions. Their onions often will have these green tops -- like a big onion bulb with the green tops. They are what are called cebolla, more like a spring onion, but also more like Vidalia. Lots of leek, cabbage and beans. Foods that are grown in the moment and then made to last. So drying out beans, drying out peppers, canning tuna, preserved foods.\nAT: Tell me more about how Basque cuisine deals with the red pepper hull. Red peppers and those nice oily, rusty, red sauces are a hallmark of it. How do Basque cooks preserve their peppers?\nAR: There are a number of different kinds of pepper, and each pepper has its own application. That\u2019s one thing that is very typical of Basque cuisine is that it\u2019s very specific. You don\u2019t treat all peppers in the same way.\nThey have these beautiful, sweet peppers that have a really pliable flesh that roasts beautifully. They are called piquillo peppers. They\u2019re great for stuffing, cutting in thin ribbons and mixing into food, or pureeing and making into vinaigrettes. Those are rarely eaten fresh. It\u2019s a thing that you actually would buy jarred or canned, or even your grandmother would can and jar a bunch. Then you would pull them out as needed.\nThere are peppers that are ideal for drying. Those are the choricero peppers. They are called choricero peppers because they were used to make chorizo. They braid them up -- how people make garlic braids, hang up onion or anything that they want to be a storage vegetable. But in this case, they\u2019re turned into these long skeins of peppers. They hang them outside their houses from their windows; that\u2019s where they dry them out so that they have proper ventilation. This is a very typical part of the landscape that you see -- these homes with these peppers hanging off of them. They are very postcard pretty, but they do have a purpose. They have a purpose in every house because that\u2019s the thing in the Basque Country.\nEverybody cooks similarly. The personal side of it is these very subtle details or tweaks that would belong to your mother, your grandmother, your aunt\u2019s way of doing things. But fundamentally, people eat the same from home to home, restaurant to restaurant and from home to restaurant even.\nRaij's recipe: Garden Snails in Bizka\u00edna Sauce (Photo: Penny De Los Santos)\nAT: I love that simplicity.?\nAR: I have too high of a regard for Basque food to take too many liberties. I want it to be recognized as Basque food, especially because I\u2019m not cooking in the Basque Country. We\u2019ve had the privilege of always cooking on our own terms. But, having said that, we define our style very, very narrowly, much more narrowly than might be satisfying to another kind of cook.\nI am just infinitely inspired by Basque cooking, Basque ingredients and the Basque landscape. Even though it\u2019s narrow, I don\u2019t find it limiting at all. In fact, I find it more freeing. There\u2019s a logic that is not arbitrary at all. That brings a lot of elegance and grace to our cooking.\nAT: That reminds me of a sauce I really want to hear more about: Salsa Bizka\u00edna. That\u2019s one of those red pepper-based sauces.\nAR: I\u2019m actually glad you asked about that sauce because the Basque Country is composed of all these little provinces and towns. Bizkaia is where my husband is from, so he feels super strongly about that particular sauce.\nAT: It looks so good. I love how you describe it as \u201cdoped up\u201d with bacon and chorizo.\nAR: I\u2019m always looking for equivalents for people. For me, that sauce is like the Basque version of all'amatriciana sauce. If that\u2019s a pasta sauce that you like, you would love this dish. It has good textures; it has this deep, rich, sunburnt flavor to it. It\u2019s also just incredibly unique. I have to draw comparisons to other things, and yet I\u2019ve never had anything like that sauce anywhere else. It\u2019s just very mellow and balanced.\nWe make a snail stew. We buy Burgundy and escargot. We chop up pieces of chorizo, ham, bacon and bay leaf, then we braise them in that sauce.\nAT: How does cooking Basque food filter down to the way that you live your daily life?\nAR: The thing about Basque cooking is that everybody in the Basque Country and everybody in my house, all my life, cooks. It\u2019s not something that you choose to do, you do it because it\u2019s part of who you are. People might do it with more or less pleasure, but they never do it halfway. There\u2019s not a loveless meal in the Basque Country.\nAmy.",

    "context": "The man whose cremation was to take place had never been a favourite of mine. While I personally could be anything- good or bad, righteous or unjust, but the fact remains that I always had the highest regard for people who have genuinely and truthfully abided by laws. Thus to take a random name, I always admired Devesh Chaturvedi, who had been my District Magistrate in Pithoragarh and Deoria, for the simple fact that Devesh believed in the supremacy of law- for one and all, including himself.\nFrom, whatever I had heard of Shashank Shekhar Singh, Triple S as he was often called, I was always wary of him. His image in my mind was that of a person who was not made for law, but for whom law molded and amended itself. And I can say with surety that I was not the only person who thought in this particular manner. A very large section of the bureaucracy often echoed this feeling, when talking in their private conversations.\nBut as the saying goes- Nothing succeeds like success and Shashank Shekhar succeeded in Uttar Pradesh bureaucracy like no one had before him and possibly no one will again in a long time to come.\nThe five year period 2007-2012 definitely added to his image, power and persona. It made him a larger than life figure- at least in the power corridors of UP, with its reverberations being seen naturally all across the State and also in the country.\nThus Shashank Shekhar was a mysterious figure in the eyes and opinions of many who equated him with power and authority.\nWhen his death came all too suddenly and all too quickly after his retirement only a few ago, it shocked most of the people. While not knowing much about others, at least my natural feeling was that of strange remorse and vacuum. Being truthful to myself, I would admit that it was not primarily guided by some genuine emotional outburst for the departed soul, because it had never been so, but was the result of the strange eeriness that death often accompanies.\nWhen coming back from the office yesterday, I saw a large gathering at Bhaisa Kund, the Lucknow funeral ground, my feet automatically stopped in strange fascination of death.\nIt was here that I once again realized that whether one hated or loved Shashank Shekar, the fact remains that he was a powerful persona, someone who commanded authority and had aura around him- something which had not left him even after death.\nIn the midst of the people present there one could see many powerful people- bureaucrats, police officers, politicians etc, along with media persons rushing around to get a snap of the man who lived and died like a King. Even the way his body had been wrapped so elegantly and delicately seemed to be a homage to the man who was always believed to have fine tastes in life.\nMy stay at Bhaisa Kund convinced me once more that this man was different from others and he was born to command.",

    "context": "Postaday2011-On Occupy Wall Street, Food Service, and Richard Rahl 08 Saturday Oct 2011 Posted by Antigone's Clamor in Life, Politics, postaday2011, The Economy \u2248 2 Comments So just to let you guys know\u2026the anxious refreshing of my gmail account has temporarily ceased! I have an interview invitation for one of the nursing programs I applied to for October 24th (the day after my 21st). Right now, I am one nervous and thankful girl!! Hopefully, there will be a second invitation coming next week! On another note, I\u2019ve been enjoying reading about Occupy Wall Street, especially since I\u2019m part of the 99%. Many of you, I\u2019m sure, will be disappointed over my ambivalence, but I truly sympathize with my fellow 99 percenters. The job market IS tough out there, especially for those who didn\u2019t have jobs in high school or worked in professions like food service. It\u2019s difficult to get a job in or right after college. But, on the other hand, I do have a few theories about it that I\u2019ll share, controversial as they may be. I\u2019ve been working as a recruiter for the test prep company, and I\u2019ve also tried to recruit new people for my caregiving job\u2026a lot of people complain about not getting jobs, but it\u2019s amazing how many people will turn down work! I have been given a myriad of reasons, like not wanting to drive an extra fifteen miles or not wanting to put time in for training\u2026this is all well and good, but it\u2019s still a JOB. Which is MONEY. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but it\u2019s really hard for me to turn down work. Sometimes I have to, because I just work too many hours to fit other work in. So I do think that some people CAN work, but choose not to because the job is not ideal. After graduation, I noticed that my acquaintances who struggled to find a job were also the one who had party pics and careless Facebook status\u2026coincidence? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not. This is all coming from my upper-middle class background (although I have worked at least part-time since I was fifteen and babysat before that), but for my sweet fianc\u00e9, life has not always been so easy. He didn\u2019t have the benefit of being able to volunteer or work more skilled jobs. He just had to take what was available, which was factory work and retail. Then, when he went off to a college town, it took a year and a half to find a job!! That was not for lack of trying, either. Now, he works two part-time jobs very diligently and with an admirable attitude. (If I had to work food service like he does, I would blow up every day\u2026it\u2019s wayyy too chaotic and disorganized for someone like me!! Plus, management at those places is usually a nightmare). Eventually, with enough training, he\u2019ll be able to bridge into his field, but it\u2019s going to take awhile. Sometimes getting somewhere takes a lot of persistence and time, especially when you have to do it ALL by yourself. Anyway, he is one of the best workers I know and such great husband material, but I\u2019ll stop before I embarrass him too much. So yes, the job market is tough for young people, but I think that with compromise and sacrifice, it\u2019s doable. Saving for college is so important, because it\u2019s nearly impossible to pay by yourself to go full-time. Taking out loans for school is different than it used to be, and I\u2019ve known a lot of people that it\u2019s really hurt. Loans are larger, because tuition has risen exponentially. Scholarships often tuition, but not fees, which totaled almost $2000 at the university I attended. After graduation, loans have to be paid back, and because of the job situation, most people can\u2019t afford to pay. Grad school and moving back in with parents is the only option for most people. Even though I have two great jobs and work over 50 hours a week, I still live with my parents. It hasn\u2019t been practical to move out yet. I sympathize so much for people who have these nice degrees, huge loans, and crappy jobs. One day, it might get better, but until the economy bounces back, it\u2019s going to be hard. The biggest improvement that I think individuals can make is to help others out, especially Christians. If someone with a bit money would wisely invest in a younger person who is struggling through school, or if someone with connections helped another person get a better job, I think the state of the nation would be drastically improved! So many people have needs that none of us know about, and I think that many of the problems we\u2019re facing as a nation could have been avoided if we, as the Church stepped up and served our fellow neighbors, even in little ways. Though I tend to be more conservative politically, I do appreciate programs, because they can do a lot of good. I also think we could avoid dumping money into programs by enabling people to help themselves. I desperately want things to change on a national level, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll change permanently unless they change on the individual level. That takes time, patience, money, and love. I know we won\u2019t be successful for several more years, and we may all get there when we\u2019re closer to 30 than 20. To those who are struggling right now, a Richard Rahl quote comes to mind: Your life is yours alone; rise up and live it!

A Great game between two fine teams who played with emotion, skill and guts.\nNow people of the United States it is time to get back to what I call the Stooper Bowl, the election season of 2012. The Republicans now have a front-runner beyond doubt in Willard Mitt Romney whom I call Moe. Moe is trying to clear up the problems with the other Stooges and remove them from his path to his destiny, he believes. Moe\u2019s brothers are Curly- Gingrich, Shemp-Santorum and of course their age old partner Larry- Ron Paul. Like the Three Stooges from the old days they prank, poke and jolt and push Moe and he does it back. And it all looks so funny and nice for public consumption, everyone forgets, this is indeed a Presidential Election in 2012!.\nMoe has won two states and has some delegates behind him now and is charging for a third me thinks or is it a fourth. Lets see he took New Hampshire, and lost Iowa, lost in South Carolina, won in Florida and now Nevada, ok so three. Yet the other stooges won\u2019t drop out and back their brother Moe-Romney because he isn\u2019t conservative enough, silly!.\nA little advice for the remaining three Stooges may be in store!. One Curly-Gingrich/ Two-Shemp-Santorum/Three-Larry-Paul, the longer you stay in this race the worse you make the chance of your party winning in November. Second piece of advice to understand, money does not grow on trees boys, the money trees are about to get hit by a frost and deep freeze. If you can\u2019t show a win that will propel you to the Nomination why would money back you? Wakey, Wakey boys, the facts are gonna bite you all in the ass!.\nMitt Romney-Moe in my opinion is out distancing his opponents the Stooges, because he looks presidential, he acts it and he has the money to do so.The real question is this though, can he overcome his inexperience and talk straight talk to the American people and can he out talk President Obama and get the facts straight? I doubt at this point if he can beat President Obama, the reasoning is simple, Obama is the Incumbant, his record will carry him through it and when you attack his record you will attack your own party not his. Republicans made the stalemate and log jam in Washington, not the Democrats.

Accompany it with the pitter-patter sound of the rain and the package of melancholic effect is completed. Nonetheless, I have grown to love it.\nBefore, I actually despise the rain (check this and that). My concept of it is sadness and nostalgia. It is actually depressing when memories are reminisced.\nUntil one afternoon, as I have awaken from a nap, I feel a pang of dejection which I know is not new. Although, I have always tried to be cheery in a way, it is not exactly in my nature. Disillusionment is my way of lessening all the discomfort I experience. The earlier the realisation, the earlier the acceptance, perhaps. That is why I have learned to embrace the sadness, it makes me stronger.\nThat\u2019s when I hear the sky screaming in agony and with it are its tears. It is soothing in a way only I could fathom.

    "context": "Welcome to today\u2019s insight! Stren #16 explains the multiple benefits that place self-endorsement among the most important of all the skills that we require to survive and thrive in today\u2019s world. You will appreciate the series of self-endorsement techniques that follow and will eagerly add them to your collection of wisdoms.\nHere is the simple explanation of why self-endorsement skills are essential for our well-being. Instinct and tradition hardwire their preferred problem-solving action pathways in the older part of our brain where emotion resides. We create common sense solutions to today\u2019s problems applying new knowledge and wisdom using the last to mature intelligent cerebral cortex portion of our brain, what I label our \u201cfreedom organ.\u201d Emotion usually trumps intellect, so self-endorsement is our freedom organ\u2019s powerful means to add sufficient emotion to intelligence to override the established action pathways of instinct and tradition. Now be impressed as we consider the beneficial power of self-endorsement, the opposite of the more common habit of engaging in self-putdowns.\nAll of us are born helpless and totally dependent on others to survive and thrive. As would be expected, we quickly learn to seek the approval of those \u201cothers\u201d who are the source of our well-being. Until we teach ourselves sufficient self-endorsement skills to make ourselves emotionally whole, we will continue to depend on others to sustain our well-being. And of course, if others are the source of what good we experience, whatever frustration we experience must also be attributed to them as well. Blaming others is indicative of immaturity. Blaming is a common ingredient of self-serving dictators who remain stuck in the immature belief that someone or something other than themselves is the source of their distress and must be punished. Blaming others, which leads to harmful aggression, is our most primitive and prevalent automatic response to frustration. The greatest instances of today\u2019s problems, both global and local, are the outcome of our innate and early-acquired blaming pattern. Blaming becomes habit through repetition during our decades of dependency. Self-endorsement is our opportunity to make a quantum leap towards self-mastery, to become our own person. Self-endorsement skills are the means by which we assume responsibility to make our life\u2019s experience joyous and meaningful. Our skill in self-endorsement serves as a marvelous role model that benefits our loved ones. Self-endorsement is the antidote for the more common nonproductive self-putdown skills we learn.\nSadly, a common way our society teaches us to divert our anger and aggression towards others is by redirecting it to ourselves. This process is called \u201cguilt.\u201d Guilt is directing harmful aggression to our self instead of towards others; what I call \u201cblaming in\u201d instead of \u201cblaming out.\u201d Guilt is a unique human quality we learn from expert teachers. Blaming others and blaming ourselves rarely lead to lasting constructive outcomes. Blaming most commonly results in physical confrontation, resentment, stress disease, depression, apathy, and a host of other maladies.\nStren # 16: The Importance of Self-endorsement\n- Details\n- Category: The Maxi Course\n-\n- Written by Don Pet\n- Hits: 2795",

    "context": ".\nLong-term Spawning in ARIS\nI began this game after a conversation with Phil on the arisgames list about how spawning really works in ARIS based questions from play tests of Los Duendes (a game inspired by Truchas by Earl Shank and Anthony Thompson, play it too). It was clear that it was possible to make games where spawning intervals spanned really large timeframes. But how would this work in practice?\nHere\u2019s the spawning settings for my Golden Goose:\nThe important parts are that I\u2019m spawning 1 goose total (not per player) every 10,000 seconds, and that that goose will disappear once viewed. I began with 6 hours between spawns, but that felt too long.\nBTW \u2013 The goose is a plaque that hands out an item (Golden Egg). Never use items directly.\nFranchising the Leaderboard\nWhy have a game where you collect points when no one else can see those points? In Rupee Collector, there is a leaderboard based on a reskinning of the web backpack. Toussaint Minett put it together for me at our game jam last August using some basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS hosted on an ARIS server. That\u2019s all well and fine for Rupee Collector, but what about other games? None of our other authors would be able to make something like that for their games, nor could I replicate the effort for another game. Well, I wanted to see if I could.\nFor Golden Goose, I got ahold of Toussaint\u2019s work, poked around in the files for the relevant calls, and was able to get it working, hosted in my dropbox public folder. Total hack, but it works!\nThe Golden Goose Leaderboard\nThis is still a couple of steps away from making it easy for others to follow this lead, but it is a significant step and really only took me about an hour to get up and looking nice. The work is in making it easily parseable for others so they don\u2019t have to repeat my troubleshooting process. I think this also points the way toward more involved multiplayer ARIS games. If we can display other players\u2019 stats to you as a player, we\u2019re only a few steps away from being able to have that information directly affect the game world itself.\nDynamics of Global Competitive Play\nWhat would happen if you made an ARIS game the whole world could play together? We\u2019ve talked about this a lot, usually along the lines of diffuse data gathering activities, or worldwide scavenger hunts. The problem is that the ideas that come up in this vein are usually pretty grandiose. They tend to only succeed when a lot of players do a lot of work. I wanted to engage with this idea, to get it off the ground with something simpler. Competitive play, comparison of a single variable, along with the super-simple activity of simply logging in to play felt like enough to attract the idle curiosity of players far and wide.\nBefore launching the game, I shared the game with a few friends and students to test it out. If you read the screenshot of the leaderboard above, you\u2019ll know that something interesting happened. One player decided he wanted to win big time. Gabe both played often enough to be able to usually ice out anyone else from being able to get eggs and found exploits in the timing of ARIS\u2019s delete when viewed function to quickly get to 500 eggs. This is the default max of item in ARIS, something I hadn\u2019t changed because I thought \u201cThis game is hard, 500 is a long way off\u201d. The max eggs didn\u2019t stop him from long though. He just made another account and started playing from there.\nSo, before even launching, I feel like I learned a lot about how my ideal rules for the game actually might work out in practice. There are a lot of possible fixes. I think the one that appeals most to me is to have the game function more like \u201cThe World vs. Gabe\u201d by finding a way to sum across all the other player accounts when rendering the leaderboard.\nMicro-attention Gameplay\nThe comparison with Cow Clicker is made because in some sense, the aim of Golden Goose is to get a large number of people logging into the same ARIS game of their own volition, and beyond that aim there isn\u2019t a whole lot. The idea is part satire and part predatory business strategy. And though I don\u2019t have any microtransactions in Golden Goose, I am curious if it will be successful in this respect. I wonder too if seeing Gabe\u2019s scores will have the effect of turning people on or off, if it will seem too daunting or whether it will kindle their competitive instincts. Already, I\u2019ve got a bit of evidence of both. Here\u2019s a text I received from Breanne Litts after a frustrated week of trying to get eggs.\nHi Chris, did you wind up posting the code behind the leaderboard somewhere publicly accessible? I\u2019d love to try implementing it in one of my games.\nI put it in my dropbox public folder. There\u2019s supposed o be a way to host code from google drive too, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to try and work it out yet.\nARIS 2 created a lot of changes for how to do a leaderboard, but I\u2019ve adapted and have a tutorial ready:\nPingback: Algorithmic AR \u2013 Part 2 | Local games lab ABQ\nPingback: Introduction to ARISjs \u2013 Leaderboards in ARIS 2 | Local games lab ABQ",

    "context": "Finding the Best Chiropractic Services in Colombia\nChoosing a chiropractor can be hectic especially if you have never tried it before but with some handy tips, you can get the right one. This process is made hectic by the fact that many chiropractors in Colombia claim to offer the best services, but that is not true because each one of them has a specialization. However, finding the right chiropractor can be cumbersome especially if you do not know how to go about it. Below is a guide on how you can find the most suitable chiropractor to attend to your needs.\nEstablish the type of chiropractor you want \u2013 As a lay person, you may not be aware of the types of chiropractors that are available, but at least you can identify the part of the body that is aching. Are you feeling pain in your neck, back, hip or your leg? If you have a back pain, then you must get a chiropractor who specializes in treating such pains.\nGet a chiropractor close to you \u2013 In Colombia, there are many chiropractors, and there is no need of looking for a chiropractor based in a distant place. A nearby chiropractor gives you the attention that you need, and in cases where the pains are extreme, and you cannot move a long distance, he can come to treat you at your premises. In some cases, you might need routine procedures that might run for several days, and if the service is close to you, you will not need to spend heavily on the fare. It might be hectic and costly to travel a long distance in search of chiropractic services.\nResearch \u2013 Get more information about the chiropractors that you have identified around you. The internet can be quite helpful because the chiropractors have their profiles on their websites and you can access it. Websites reveal a lot of information which might include qualifications and experience. Make sure that your prospective chiropractors are qualified, licensed and experienced to perform their duties.\nSeek an appointment with the chiropractors \u2013 All that people tell you, and you read from the websites are not enough to convince you. Alternatively, you have time; you can walk to the office and see the environment. It helps you to gauge whether the doctor is friendly and competent to handle your problems. Meet the doctor in his office so that you get the feel of the environment and also see the state of the equipment he uses for therapy.\nService rate \u2013 Chiropractic services are expensive and sometimes beyond the reach of many people. The service rates are varied depending on the chiropractor and service you want. Do not opt for low-cost service because it can be poor and not helpful. Some services might accept insurance policy covers, and that can be a relief to you if you have an insurance policy.\nWhat Has Changed Recently With Wellness?\nGetting Creative With Businesses Advice",
    "question": "What factors should be considered when choosing a chiropractor in Colombia?",
    "answer": "When choosing a chiropractor in Colombia, one should consider the type of chiropractor they need based on their specific pain area, the proximity of the chiropractor to their location, the qualifications, licensing, and experience of the chiropractor, the environment and equipment of the chiropractor's office, and the service rate of the chiropractor. It's also beneficial if the chiropractor accepts insurance policy covers.",

This smells lovely and I would say is quite heavily rose based so if that\u2019s not your thing then you probably wouldn\u2019t want this one. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of rose in makeup products but on my hair I actually quite like it as it smells quite sophisticated but not grannyish!\nIn terms of formula, I love the shampoo because it feels like it\u2019s doing a great job of cleaning my hair and scalp without stripping it or leaving any heavy residue. I\u2019ve been having a real issue with product build up in the underneath sections of my hair so i\u2019m super aware of using thick shampoos at the moment! It lathers up really well so you don\u2019t have to use too much product which is great and of course means the bottle lasts longer too.\nThe conditioner was a real surprise for me as i\u2019ve never used anything quite like it. It\u2019s in the traditional creamy form which you can apply to the hair and leave for a few minutes to do it\u2019s magic. But when you wash it out it is gone straight away and there\u2019s no immediate silky smooth feeling like with your standard conditioner but instead i\u2019ve found it leaves the hair very soft and nourished when dry. If you can get past the initial application and wash off then I promise you\u2019ll feel the benefits afterwards. I genuinely feel like my hair loves these products and what\u2019s even better is that they are made without sulphates, parabens or artificial fragrances.\nAt just under six pounds per bottle these are definitely on the slightly higher priced end but that being said they are made with great ingredients which for me justifies the price.

    "context": "The first was a few weeks ago with my friend Meredith. We were brewing ideas about what to do with our afternoons and our friends, and Lake Matoaka came up. Then Jamestown Beach. Then Virginia Beach. Then California. Then Australia. And there's only one place better than Australia.\nAs the climax to this frenzy of outlandish suggestions about where to take our friends on a Sunday afternoon, Meredith suggested that we go to Heaven. This got me thinking quite seriously all of a sudden: what if we went to Heaven just for a few minutes and came back? I was focused less on the metaphysical implications of the event itself and more on the effect on our daily lives from then on out.\nHeaven is something we trust that is true, but we do not know it experientially. We have seen echoes and reminders throughout nature and glimpses in worship, but these have all been merely glorious suggestions of the real thing. If all of a sudden we had that fulfilled knowledge, assuming we would be able to function after seeing our true home and experiencing true fulfillment and then leaving it, wouldn't we live with that as our frame of reference? It would such a strong impression that we would never stop living for it; it would never be out of our minds.\nI don't think that the situation just described would be the perfect one, because through our broken journeys God teaches us and draws us to himself and improves us; experiencing the end result would be to cut out the journey of growth. But it is a really intriguing thought experiment to consider, because I do want to live with eternity in mind.\nAnother friend, later, mentioned the song Eden by Phil Wickham. She said that in a strange way it made her sad; not necessarily depressed, but sad that she was not yet in the state of bliss with God that the song speaks about, that she has to face each earthly day with its troubles. I told her not to see it primarily as something she doesn't have, but something that she will have, that has been promised to her, something she can live for. It is a sobering thought, but I believe it is also one that can remind us who we are, where we're going, and why we're here.\nHey Zach - fun thoughts! I have to say, though, that I think if we went to Heaven for a glimpse, and began to live from that reality ~ it would give us such a strong presence of TRUTH that we would be equipped to share the gospel so much more clearly through our being! Not only that, but we would still have the heartaches that \"grow us up\" in the Lord; I can't imagine we would not still be longing for the better; actually I think we would crave it even more, and find our sin natures to be even more disturbing...and hurtful ~ likely it would add to our growth along the path (in my perspective) ~ but, certainly God has not shown many the glimpse, so perhaps your perspective is more accurate ;)",

    "context": "Through A Narrow Chink: An Ethical Dilemma Essay, Research Paper\nThrough A Narrow Chink: An Ethical Dilemma\nby Pablo Baez\nChemistry 104\nProf. Holme\nIn 1951 Carl Djerassi, with the Mexican pharmaceutical company Syntex, developed the first oral contraceptive by synthesizing and altering the natural hormone Progesterone into a superpotent, highly effective oral progestational hormone called \u201cnorethindrone\u201d.\nAdmittedly, the dynamics and importance of this find were astounding, since before this the only means of contraception was abortion, and even that was not legalized at the time.\nThe race to produce this synthetic agent was highly competitive, being sought after by many pharmaceuticals throughout the world, and for a small fledgling company in Mexico of all places to find it first only added to the excitement of the achievement.\nYet aside from all this excitement and competitive fervor something great and disturbing was being bypassed. Science, in my view had done something great without looking into the possibilities of where this would lead.\nI believe Djerassi, similar to most scientists of his day, was so entranced by the excitement of synthesizing his product and achieving his goal that he did not stop to think of the ramifications of his accomplishment. The ethical dilemma was not explored before hand, and this to me is the great tragedy of most scientific discovery, since I firmly believe each scientist is responsible for that which he creates.\nDjerassi does confront a few questions of ethics and morality after the fact.\nOn page 61, in chapter 6, he reflects on the argument of the use of poor Mexican and Puertorrican women for preliminary experiments. Is this just another manifestation of exploitation of the poor?\nDjerassi says absolutely not.\nYes, the poor our the initial guinea pigs for research but this is no different from what dentists, barbers, and young surgeons do. All of these groups use medical ethics and moral responsibility must become wed with research in the minds of scientists for a real change in perspective to occur.\nIn 1994, my wife came home one day with tears in her eyes after having gone to the Gynecologist for a regular check up. She mumbled through shaky lips the words cervical cancer and something about a biopsy. I was mortified. Somehow, at the young age of 25, my wife had gotten the beginnings of cervical cancer and something had to be done fast. After a few tense days of waiting for the biopsy results we were told she should have cryogenic surgery for the removal of the tissue. It was removed and we were told not to worry.\nInquiring as to how such a young woman could have gotten cancer our doctor said it was a possible side effect of using the same Pill prescription for so long. We had never known this. If we had known we would never have used it!\nPersonally, that scare was enough to prove to me that scientific research and development must be extraordinarily careful as to what it finds as acceptable risk.\nWilliam Blake was quoted by Djerassi as saying in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: \u201cIf the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite\u201d. This infinite view of all means that everything overlaps, interconnects into an almost constant dance between particles, people, and ideas. In other words nothing is independent and of itself. If this simple concept of everything being related were to be assimilated into all that we think and do, imagine the difference it would make. But our problem as Blake continues is: \u201c\u2026 man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro\u2019 narrow chinks of his cavern.\u201d\nDjerassi admits that only late in his life did he begin to widen those chinks. He realized he had not seem all that was there, leading a sheltered life with a somewhat narrow scientific perspective. He sustained social and political attacks about the side effects of the Pill, survived through three marriages, and dealt with the suicide of his depressed daughter. Arguably, he had had a rewarding yet tough life.\nBut like my incidence with the side effects of the pill, his lack of respect for the relationships between science and the rest of the world has cost many dearly.\nYes, he has later in life admitted to his narrow sighted perspective of his younger years, but that still doesn\u2019t address the issue that today\u2019s scientists are still being trained in the same manner and with the same tunnel vision. Something must be done, and it falls to the senior scientists such as himself to rectify the problem!\n35.",

    "context": "Though this is \"my project\", since my son is benefiting from the end results I wanted his help getting some of the measurements and running some of the cable. I have my little carefully drawn geeky diagrams on how I want to set things up for now and where I will be changing them later as I am moving things into a room of my own I hope soon. (Of course I have been saying that for many years, but I really have done some work in fits and starts to move that process along. There is an untold story about avoiding certain kinds of change because it means completely and finally accepting something I have been resisting, but I am not sure I am ever going to tell it in detail on the blog.)\nAt any rate I intended to do all of that yesterday including going out to purchase the router and cable I need, then spending today setting up and configuring everything. Instead my son and his girlfriend went to the beach.\nAfter being on the periphery of several minor (but testosterone laden) hassles today, I finally have the figures for what is needed for the hoped for - current setup, have ordered the router and cable lengths with connectors attached and everything will be here in the morning. I might even get a chance to start setting everything up before I leave for class. It turns out that if I want it quickly, Office Depot has the best price on the router I chose, and their cable prices are within pennies both lower and higher than other places. Click, click and I am done with a bonus of free shipping and delivery. I truly don't like parking in shopping centers and the hassles of standing in long lines to get what I need.\nI hope I ordered the right Linksys Cable DSL router/gateway/switch. I notice now that there is one additional letter in the model number than the one I had been looking at everywhere else. It has an extra capability that I am not sure I needed or wanted. I am such a scatter brained person when I am interrupted sometimes.\nNow that it is closer, I am really excited about having high speed internet access. It will be a touch disappointing if it is the wrong router or a huge hassle to set up.",

You might want to read Jessie Hearts New York to become a believer again.\nTitle: Jessie \u2665 NYC by Keris Stainton\nPages: 255\nRelease Date: July 7th 2011\nPublished by: Orchard\nSource: Author (thanks Keris!)\nBuy: Amazon | Book Depository\nSummary:?\nJourney through Broadway, see the Empire State Building and feel what it's like to be in New York in this sweet novel about meeting at the right place at the right time but never really seeing each other and finding love at the place you least expect to.\nJessie had always dreamed about living in New York. Now she's mending a broken heart and her mother is successfully conquering Broadway with a play she wrote, Jessie, together with her friend Emma, flew to the famed city that never sleeps, New York. Finn, a New Yorker, has been living in New York for quite a while and he's in a dilemma. He's in love with Sam. The only problem is, Sam is his best friend's girlfriend. They were part of the thousands of people living in a city as big as New York, but when Fate intervenes, will they grab the chance to be with each other?\nJessie was finally living her dream of being in New York but she also had problems to deal with even when she's in the city she wanted to live all her life. Jessie still feels like her mom loves her work more than her, and the guy she likes, Ben, might not be into her like she think he is. Jessie is a vibrant teenage girl. Very normal. She feels unloved by her mother and she just really wants to have fun in New York. Finn is this cute guy who's been pining for a girl he knew he can never have. He's a genuinely good guy who deserves to have someone to love him wholeheartedly. He's charming, but he's at a crossroads in his life. To follow a path that will make his parents happy or go out on his own and do what he loves?\nSerendipity. I have never been one to believe in destined meetings or coincidences but I guess if something was meant to be then it will be.Finn and Jessie are just two amongst thousands of people living in New York, but they have been connected to each other closer than they think. I find it extremely cute how Jessie bumps into a guy in a diner, not knowing it was Finn all along. Or how Jessie talking about her father's love of architecture has influenced Finn to follow his dreams of being an architect himself than be an insurance guy. Finn didn't know it was Jessie talking. Both of them were present during the moments that defined certain parts of their life during their stay in New York and it gave them a deep connection even before they actually meet! How amazing and rare is that? Is it really possible?\nThe chance meeting and the way each of their lives progresses alongside each other felt unique for me. Simultaneously happening but totally independent of each other. It's certainly an interesting way of presenting stories of two people who will inevitably meet and realize they were meant for each other. There was enough drama happening on both Finn and Jessie to keep readers distracted and just when you think they will never meet, the story takes a magical turn and then everything falls into the right place.\nIt might just be me, but I have issues with Jessie's mother. I have nothing against older women dating younger men, but I felt that her shortcomings as a mother should not have been easily let off. Maybe because my values are different, but it took me a while to take in Jessie's family's situation. It was definitely awkward. Also! Emma is another interesting character whose story I'm looking forward to reading. And this book just made me want to go to New York!\nJessie Hearts NYC is a lovely story that tells us that sometimes, the person we need to complete us is closer to us than we think. In Jessie and Finn's case, it took them quite a few number of times, being in the same place at the same time, liking the same Sesame Street character and wanting to marry them, crashing one's birthday parties and meeting at a restaurant without planning to. Awfully romantic, sweet and entertaining, it's a story that shows us just how mysterious the universe works.\nContent (plot, story flow, character):\nShining: Worthy of a Goddess' Love!\nBook Cover:\nI received this book free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review.\nGlad to hear you enjoyed this book. I've been hearing good things about it.\nI want to read this so badly! Thanks for the great review!! (:\nOne of the best pieces of fluff around!

    "context": "I did it, too!\nWhenever I ran into a word in the Bible that I did not understand . . . then I just skipped over it.\nAbout fifteen years ago I visited Israel because my daughter and my grandchildren lived in Jerusalem.\nThat was the last time I just \"skipped\" over things in the Bible that I did not understand.\nWow! That has made a huge difference in understanding the END TIME scenario.\nNow, I purposefully look up these words and research them\nI noticed something: every nation that Jesus will fight against when he returns is a Muslim nation.\nEvery country that surrounds Israel is a Muslim nation: Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey, not to mention Iraq and Iran.\nEven Gog and Magog (that we were previously told by U.S. \"scholars\" was Russia) were regions in Eastern Turkey!\nForget about the European Union and the papacy being enemies of the Muslim nations.\nIf you really want to understand the END TIMES, then read Isaiah 63:1-6, Habakkuk 3:1-7, and Revelation 19. Just for your information: it is approximately 180 miles from Haifa to Petra!\nJesus is not coming back as the Sunday School Jesus, all meek and mild. The first time he came here\nhe came as a baby in a manger.\nThe next time Jesus comes he will be \"The Lord of Heaven's Armies\" (YHWH tseba' oth). And it is possible that many people sitting in the pews will not even know who he is. They are expecting him to land on the Mt. of Olives. Oh, he will stand on the Mt. of Olives all right, but he is coming from Edom, and more specifically from Bozrah!\nWhere is Edom and Bozrah?\nEdom is modern Jordan, and Bozrah is a city in that nation which is now named Bouseira, very near Petra (a well-visited tourist spot near Saudia Arabia), which is also in Jordan.\nHe will have blood spattered all over his white uniform (Rev. 19:13 and Isaiah 63:1). Why is he spattered with blood? Because he will be a Mighty Warrior (another truth the Sunday School crowd finds difficult to believe).\n\"Who is this who comes from Edom, from the city of Bozrah, with his clothing stained red? Who is this in ROYAL ROBES, marching in his great strength?\"\nWho wears ROYAL ROBES except the Lord Jesus Christ? Who MARCHES IN GREAT STRENGTH except Jesus?\nThen he answers his rhetorical question: \"It is I, THE LORD,announcing your salvation! It is I, THE LORD, who has the power to save.\"\nThis is not complicated, folks. He spells it out for us. There is only one person who has the power to save, and it is the Lord Jesus Christ!\n\"Why are your clothes (uniform) so red, as if you have been treading out grapes?\"\nGet the picture? A man in a white uniform in a pool of grapes. What would he look like after just the first few minutes squishing out the grapes? Now you have the picture in your mind of Jesus as he makes his way from Saudia Arabia and Jordan to the Mt. of Olives in Jerusalem, Israel.\n (the Jews), and to ransom them from their oppressors (Arab Muslims). I was amazed (even Jesus is amazed by the cowardice of the Gentiles) to see that no one intervened to help the oppressed. So I myself stepped in (from outer space: heaven) to save them with my strong arm, and my wrath sustained me (an angry God? an angry Jesus?---and here all this time he was Santa Clause). I crushed the nations in my anger and made them stagger and fall to the ground, spilling their blood upon the earth.\"\nWhy is God so angry? The answer is very simple:\nOut of all the nations on the earth, he picked Israel as his prize possession. When nations of the world killed, attacked, kidnapped, burned, tortured, and beheaded Jewish people for centuries . . . God finally blows his top.\nCan you blame him?\nOh, there is much, much more in Habakkuk chapter 3. Read it for yourself.\nThe King is actually coming . . . even if it is just a little different than what we learned in Sunday School. Too bad that we did not actually study our Bibles all those years. But the good news is that some of us are actually opening them now at the END OF TIME and learning something.\nThis is exciting news, folks, because those of us who are true believers will have indestructable bodies by then and we will be mighty warriors in an army led by Jesus Christ himself!\nIsrael means \"God Prevails\" and is mentioned 2,576 times in the Bible.\nEgypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon have a combined population of 249 million.\nIsrael's population is 7.5 million. These Muslim nations have 33 times more people than Israel. But somehow Israel continues to survive. God does \"prevail\"!",

    "context": "I grew up in Charleston, West Virginia, went to college in Wilmington, North Carolina (UNCW), and received a degree in marketing. After moving all over the southeastern U.S. and even doing a short 1 year stint in Seattle, I now live in Charleston, South Carolina.\nI have been interested in audio and video for a large part of my life. When my family purchased a Sony BetaCam back in the 1980\u2019s my siblings and I used to take it a try to make videos with it. We\u2019d shoot my band playing, silly skits, etc. This was quite a task back then because we had no way to edit anything. You pretty much had to get everything right on the first take. You couldn\u2019t even rewind the tape in the camera. You could only plop it in the BetaMax player and watch what you caught. Later on we bought a VHS deck and we could then bounce tracks back and forth between it and the BetaMax which wasn\u2019t exactly a NLE but it did allow us to do some \u201cediting.\u201d\nWe used to do the same thing with audio. I was in a band and played keyboards. Nobody I knew had a multi-track recorder so we would take two tape decks and get creative with them. Record your bass track on one tape deck, play it back and play another track along with it and record that onto another tape deck\u2026.and keep repeating until your done. After about 3 passes of doing that the first track would be so out of tune due to the differences in the decks speed that became quite humorous.\nFor me, the magic in shooting, whether it be film or video, is that moment when you get to see what you caught. I often tell people it\u2019s like fishing for crabs with a crab trap. You don\u2019t know what you have in it until you pull it all up on deck and dump it out. Sure, you try to plan your shots and make tweaks to things just as a crab fisherman would bait his traps but sometimes you come up empty. I\u2019ve watched Deadliest Catch on Discovery! It\u2019s when you get back to your computer with all of your shots and dump it all out and look at what you have that\u2019s magical.\nToday I am just blown away by what is possible. If you can dream it, you can make it. We have never had this many tools and information at our fingertips and the ability to share ideas instantly. The way the internet allows people to express their creativeness is truly powerful. I have learned more this year just by simply following a handful of blogs and Twitter than I ever could have in a school-type setting.\nAnthony Spencer",

    "context": "[an error occurred while processing this directive]\nTough weekend for Westpoint Racing\n19/4/2005 14:06 (Press Release) -\nSteve Johnson had a horror day after being involved in incidents in both of today's 50 lap races. In the first race Johnson was sandwiched between several cars on the first lap causing damage to the front of his Westpoint Ford Falcon. The team replaced the front splitter and changed two damaged tyres. Starting from 13th, Johnson crossed the line several laps down, in 26th place.\nIn the final race, Johnson was again involved in a first lap incident, one which would force him to retire immediately. When\nAnthony Tratt\nspun in-front of him near the completion of the first lap, Johnson had no-where to go but directly into the Holden driver's car.\nFor\nGlenn Seton\n, the day was a little kinder. Avoiding the accidents in both races, Seton finished 12th in today's first race and 13th in the final, incident marred, race. When\nPaul Dumbrell\n,\nCraig Baird\nand\nCameron McConville\nwere involved in a massive main-straight accident, forcing a race re-start, Seton was determined to bring his Falcon home safely for strong points.\nFollowing the weekend's racing, Seton has risen to 12th in the overall V8 Championship and Johnson is in 16th.\nDriver Quotes\nSteve Johnson\nOn Race Three.\n\"In race three\nDavid Besnard\ntried to go around the outside of Anthony Tratt to overtake. Tratty got into the side of him coming around the corner, managing to spin himself, and collected me. At the time I was on the inside line about to pass him.\n\"I couldn't get out of the car 'cause I was parked hard up against the pit lane wall trying to keep out of the way of the others so they could get into the pits. The brakes were gone and so was the suspension, all damaged in the accident. I couldn't actually drive the car any further.\"\nOn Race Two.\n\"In race two I got sandwiched between five cars and it damaged the front bumper. The corner of the splitter was rubbing the tyre, pretty much destroying it. It took a few laps to change. The boys had to do a bit of panel beating to line up the connecting bolts. In the end they strapped it all together and got me back out so that I wouldn't lose any more laps that than I already had.\n\"It's been one of those days of motor racing that I just want to forget about. To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement.\"\nGlenn Seton\nOn the race stopping race three incident.\n\"It was quite an experience. I knocked a lot of speed off as I went through the dust on entry to the main straight. It was difficult to see where the cars were parked ahead of me, even though I was doing only 80 kays (per hour).\n\"I watched the incident go on and was trying to think where the cars might have finished up. I drove a line that I hoped would give me ample room to get through. It was a close call. Cam McConville nearly hit me up the backside, then he went down the gap and got collected by either Paul Dumbrell or Craig Baird. I was lucky.\"\nOn his weekend.\n\"Overall it's been an okay weekend. Obviously getting on the oil yesterday prevented a top ten, which was a real shame. We consistently got on with it during all three races and I'm reasonably happy with my driving. I stayed out of trouble and pushed as hard as I could and defended as good as I could.\n\"Out of this I am 12th overall in both the round and the Championship,\nso I'm quite satisfied.\"\nThe next V8 Supercar round is in Perth on May 6-8.\nRelease Date: 17/04/2005\nWestpoint Racing - DJR",
